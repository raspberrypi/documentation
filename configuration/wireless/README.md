# Wireless connectivity

A GUI is provided for setting up wireless connections in the current Raspbian with the Pixel desktop. If you are not using the Pixel desktop, you can set up wireless networking from the [command line](wireless-cli.md).

Wireless connections can be made via the network icon at the right hand end of the menu bar. If a wireless dongle is plugged in, left clicking this icon will bring up a list of available wireless networks, as shown below. If no networks are found, it will show the message "No APs found - scanning..." - wait a few seconds without closing the menu, and it should find your network.

The icons on the right show whether a network is secured or not, and its signal strength. Click the network that you want to connect to. If it is secured, a dialogue box is will prompt you to enter the network key:

Enter the key and press OK, then wait a couple of seconds. The network icon will flash briefly to show that a connection is being made. When it is ready, the icon will stop flashing and show the signal strength.
