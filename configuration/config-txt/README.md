# config.txt

The Raspberry Pi uses a configuration file instead of the [BIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS) you would expect to find on a conventional PC. The system configuration parameters, which would traditionally be edited and stored using a BIOS, are stored instead in an optional text file named `config.txt`. This is read by the GPU before the ARM CPU and Linux are initialised. It must therefore be located on the first (boot) partition of your SD card, alongside `bootcode.bin` and `start.elf`. This file is normally accessible as `/boot/config.txt` from Linux, and must be edited as [root](../../linux/usage/root.md). From Windows or OS X it is visible as a file in the only accessible part of the card. If you need to apply some of the config settings below, but you don't have a `config.txt` on your boot partition yet, simply create it as a new text file.

Any changes will only take effect after you've rebooted your Raspberry Pi. After Linux has booted, you can view the current active settings using the following commands:

- `vcgencmd get_config <config>`: this displays a specific config value, e.g. `vcgencmd get_config arm_freq`.

- `vcgencmd get_config int`: this lists all the integer config options that are set (non-zero).

- `vcgencmd get_config str`: this lists all the string config options that are set (non-null).

Note that there are a few config settings that cannot be retrieved using `vcgencmd`.

## File format

The `config.txt` file is read by the early-stage boot firmware, so it has a very simple file format. The format is a single `property=value` statement on each line, where `value` is either an integer or a string. Comments may be added, or existing config values may be commented out and disabled, by starting a line with the `#` character.

Here is an example file:

```
# Force the monitor to HDMI mode so that sound will be sent over HDMI cable
hdmi_drive=2
# Set monitor mode to DMT
hdmi_group=2
# Set monitor resolution to 1024x768 XGA 60Hz (HDMI_DMT_XGA_60)
hdmi_mode=16
# Make display smaller to stop text spilling off the screen
overscan_left=20
overscan_right=12
overscan_top=10
overscan_bottom=10
```
