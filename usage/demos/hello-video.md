# Hello video

This will play a 15 second long full HD 1080p video clip with no sound. The intention here is to demonstrate video decode and playback capability. You’ll see that the video is very smooth!

Enter the following commands to navigate to the `hello_video` folder and list the files:

```bash
cd ..
cd hello_video
ls
```

You’ll notice the `.bin` file again. This demo needs to be told what video clip to play when we run it, though, so this must be the `test.h264` file (h264 is a type of video codec).

You'll need the `./` to specify the current directory again:

```bash
./hello_video.bin test.h264
```

You should now see the video clip play. It is taken from the open source film [Big Buck Bunny] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Buck_Bunny).
