# Hello World Demo

First let's do a quick test that will ensure the previous compilation step worked correctly. This rather boring program will only display the text `Hello world!` but if it works correctly then we know all the other demos should work too.

Enter the following commands to go inside the `hello_world` folder and list the files:

```
cd hello_world
ls
```

You'll notice the `.bin` file is shown in green, this is because it is an executable file. Meaning this is the file we run to launch the program.

Use the following command to run the demo. You need the `./` to specify the current directory. Otherwise the Linux system folders are searched for the filename you type.

`./hello_world.bin`
