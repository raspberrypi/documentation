# Hello Triangle

This displays a spinning cube with different images on each side. This is intended to demonstrate OpenGL ES rendering. OpenGL is an open-source programming library for working with 3D graphics.

Enter the following commands to navigate to the `hello_triangle` folder and list its contents:

```bash
cd ..
cd hello_triangle
ls
```

You’ll see again that one of the files is green; this is the executable file as before. This demo doesn’t need any video input files like the previous one, so you can just go ahead and run the `.bin` file:

```bash
./hello_triangle.bin
```

The demo will run forever until you decide to quit. To exit the demo press `Ctrl + C`.
