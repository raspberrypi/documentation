# Hello Triangle

This displays a spinning cube with different images on each side. This is intended to demonstrate Open GL ES rendering (an open source programming library for doing 3D graphics).

Enter the following commands to navigate to the `hello_triangle` folder and list its contents.

```
cd ..
cd hello_triangle
ls
```

You'll again see one of the files is green, this is the executable file. This demo doesn't need any video input files like the previous one so you can just go ahead and run the `.bin` file.

`./hello_triangle.bin`

The demo will run forever until you decide to quit. To exit the demo press `Ctrl + C`.
