# Hello Triangle 2

This one displays two superimposed fractals, one on top of the other. You can move the mouse to change the shape of the fractal in real time. This is also intended to demonstrate Open GL ES rendering. You may recognise the Mandelbrot fractal.

```
cd ..
cd hello_triangle2
ls
```

Now run the green `.bin` file:

```
./hello_triangle2.bin
```

Now move the mouse around and you'll see the fractal changing. See if you can get it to form a perfect circle. It's a little tricky but it can be done. To exit the demo press `Ctrl + C`.
