# Mathematica & the Wolfram Language

Mathematica is a computational programming tool used in science, maths, computing and engineering first released in 1988. It is proprietary software that you can use for free on the Raspberry Pi and has been bundled with Raspberry Pi OS and NOOBS since late 2013.
