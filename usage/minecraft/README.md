# Minecraft Pi

Minecraft is a popular open worlded sandbox building game. A limited free version of Minecraft is available for the Raspberry Pi; it also comes with a programming interface. This means you can write commands and scripts in Python code to automatically build things in the game. It's a great way to learn Python and have some fun at the same time!
