# Scratch

Scratch is a visual programming tool which allows the user to create animations and games with a drag-and-drop interface. It allows you to create your own computer games, interactive stories, and animations using some programming techniques without actually having to write code. Itâ€™s a great way to get started programming on the Raspberry Pi with young people. To find out more about Scratch, visit the website at [scratch.mit.edu](http://scratch.mit.edu).
