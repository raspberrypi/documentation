## Installing standard software

There are different ways of installing software from online repositories on your Raspberry Pi, depending on where the source of the software lives.

The most common is through the command line tool APT (Advanced Packaging Tool). Some software can also be installed using other package managers.

- [APT](apt.md)
    - Use `apt install` to install software from the Raspberry Pi OS repository. This has a huge number of software pacakages available. You can use `apt-cache search <search term>` to search the database for specific software packages. 
- [Python](python.md)
    - Some Python software can be installed using Python's package manager `pip`
- [Ruby](ruby.md)
    - Some Ruby software can be installed with Ruby's package manager `ruby gems`
