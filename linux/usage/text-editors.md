# Text editors

On Linux, you have a choice of text editors. Some are easy to use but have limited functionality, others require training to use and a long time to master but offer incredible functionality.

## Desktop graphical editors

### Leafpad

On Raspbian, you'll find an editor called Leafpad. This is a simple editor which opens in a window like a normal application. It allows use of the mouse and keyboard and has tabs and syntax highlighting.

You can use keyboard shortcuts such as `Ctrl + S` to save a file and `Ctrl + X` to exit.

### IDLE

IDLE is a Python REPL and IDE, so you can write and edit Python code in a window and run it from there.

IDLE has independent windows and syntax highlighting. It's somewhat buggy but generally ok for basic use.

You can use keyboard shortcuts like `Ctrl + S` to save a file, or `Alt + P` (previous command) and `Alt + N` (next command) in the REPL.

Note IDLE uses Python2 and IDLE 3 uses Python3.

### GVim

See Vim below

## Command line editors

### Nano

GNU Nano is at the easy-to-use end of command line editors. It's installed by default so use `nano somefile.txt` to edit a file and keyboard shortcuts like `Ctrl + O` to save and `Ctrl + X` to exit.

### Vi

Vi is a very old (c. 1976) command line editor, which you will find is available on most UNIX systems and is preinstalled on Raspbian. It is succeeded by Vim (Vi Improved), which requires installation.

Unlike most editors, Vi and Vim have a number of different modes. When you open Vim you are in command mode, which means you have to switch to Insert mode to edit the file. To do this, Press the `i` key on the keyboard, then type away. To save the file you must be in command mode, so hit the Escape key to return and the command to save a file is `:w` (then hit Enter).

To search for the word 'raspberry' in a file, go to command mode and type `/raspberry` and then hit `n` and `N` to flick forward/backward through the results.

To save and exit, enter the command `:wq`. To exit without saving, enter the command `:q!`.

Depending on your keyboard configuration you may find your cursor keys don't work. In this case, you can use the H-J-K-L keys to navigate the file (Left, Down, Up, Right) in command mode.

### Vim

Vim is an extension of Vi and works in much the same way, with a number of improvements. Only Vi is installed by default so to get the full features of Vim, install it with APT:

```
sudo apt-get install vim
```

Vim also has a graphical version which opens in a window and allows interaction with the mouse. This version is installable separately:

```
sudo apt-get install vim-gnome
```

You can save configuration in a `.vimrc` file in your user's home directory.

### Emacs

GNU Emacs is the GNU flavour of powerful command line editors. An extensible, customisable text editor. You can install it with APT:

```
sudo apt-get install emacs
```

Use keyboard combination commands such as `Ctrl + x Ctrl + s` to save and `Ctrl + X Ctrl + c` to close.
