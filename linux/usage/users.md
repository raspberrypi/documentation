# Linux users

User management in Raspbian is done on the command line. The default user is `pi`, and the password is `raspberry`. You can add users and change each user's password.

## Change your password

Once you're logged in as the `pi` user, it is highly advisable to use the `passwd` command to change the default password to improve your Pi's security.

Enter `passwd` on the command line and press `Enter`. You'll be prompted to enter your current password to authenticate, and then asked for a new password. Press `Enter` on completion and you'll be asked to confirm it. Note that no characters will be displayed while entering your password. Once you've correctly confirmed your password, you'll be shown a success message (`passwd: password updated successfully`), and the new password will apply immediately.

If your user has `sudo` permissions, you can change another user's password with `passwd` preceded by the user's username. For example, `sudo passwd bob` will allow you to set the user `bob`'s password, and then some additional optional values for the user such as their name. Just press `Enter` to skip each of these options.

### Remove a user's password

You can remove the password for the user `bob` with `sudo passwd bob -d`.

## Create a new user

You can create additional users on your Raspbian installation with the `adduser` command.

Enter `sudo adduser bob` and you'll be prompted for a password for the new user `bob`. Leave this blank if you don't want a password.

### Home folder

When you create a new user, they will have a home folder in `/home/`. The `pi` user's home folder is at `/home/pi/`.

#### skel

Upon creating a new user, the contents of `/etc/skel/` will be copied to the new user's home folder. You can add or modify dot-files such as the `.bashrc` in `/etc/skel/` to your requirements, and this version will be applied to new users.

## Sudoers

The default `pi` user on Raspbian is a member of the `sudo` group. This gives the ability to run commands as root when preceded by `sudo`, and to switch to the root user with `sudo su`.

To add a new user to the `sudo` group, use the `adduser` command:

```bash
sudo adduser bob sudo
```

Note that the user `bob` will be prompted to enter their password when they run `sudo`. This differs from the behaviour of the `pi` user, since `pi` is not prompted for their password. If you wish to remove the password prompt from the new user, create a custom sudoers file and place it in the `/etc/sudoers.d` directory:

```bash
echo 'bob ALL=(ALL) NO PASSWD: ALL' | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/010_bob-nopasswd
```

Note that it is standard practice on Linux to have the user prompted for their password when they run `sudo`, since it makes the system slightly more secure.

## Delete a user

You can delete a user on your system with the command `userdel`. Apply the `-r` flag to remove their home folder too:

```bash
sudo userdel -r bob
```
