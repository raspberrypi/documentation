# Setup

A guide to setting up your Raspberry Pi.

## What you will need

### Essential

- [SD card](../installation/sd-cards.md)
    - We recommend a minimum of 8GB micro SD card, and using [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) to install an operating system onto it.
- [Display and connectivity cable](monitor-connection.md)
    - Any HDMI/DVI monitor or TV should work as a display for the Pi. For best results, use a display with HDMI input; other types of connection for older devices are also available.
- Keyboard and mouse
    - Any standard USB keyboard and mouse will work with your Raspberry Pi.
    - Wireless keyboards and mice will work if already paired.
    - For keyboard layout configuration options see [raspi-config](../configuration/raspi-config.md).
- [Power supply](../hardware/raspberrypi/power/README.md)
    - You need a good quality power supply - see [here](../hardware/raspberrypi/power/README.md) for information on the power requirements of each model of Raspberry Pi. We recommend using an official Raspberry Pi power supply - for the Pi 4B and 400 use the [type C power supply](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/type-c-power-supply/); for all other models use the [micro USB power supply](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-universal-power-supply/).

### Optional

- Network cable (not Pi Zero)
    - A network cable is used to connect your Pi to a local network and the internet.
- [USB wireless network dongle](../configuration/wireless/README.md)
    - Only required if you need wireless network connectivity and are using a model without built-in wireless functionality.
- Sound hardware
    - If your display uses an HDMI connection and has built-in speakers, you can use it to output sound.
    - Audio can also be played through speakers or headphones by connecting them to the AV jack. Speakers must have their own amplification, since the output from the Pi is not powerful enough to drive speakers directly.
