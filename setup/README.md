# Setup

A guide to setting up your Raspberry Pi

## What you will need

### Essential (for general use)

- [SD Card](../installation/sd-cards.md)
    - We recommend an 8GB class 4 SD card, ideally preinstalled with [NOOBS](../installation/noobs.md).
- [Display and connectivity cable](monitor-connection.md)
    - Any HDMI/DVI monitor and any TV should work as a display for the Pi. For best results, use one with HDMI input, but other connections are available for older devices.
- Keyboard and mouse
    - Any standard USB keyboard and mouse will work with your Raspberry Pi.
    - Wireless keyboards and mice will work if already paired.
    - For keyboard layout configuration options see [raspi-config](../configuration/raspi-config.md).
- [Power supply](../hardware/raspberrypi/power/README.md)
    - The Pi is powered by a USB Micro power supply (like most standard mobile phone chargers).
    - You'll need a good-quality power supply that can supply at least 2A at 5V for the Model 3B, or 700mA at 5V for the earlier, lower powered models.
    - Low current (~700mA) power supplies will work for basic usage, but are likely to cause the Pi to reboot if it draws too much power.

### Optional

- Ethernet (network) cable [Model B/B+/2/3 only]
    - An Ethernet cable is used to connect your Pi to a local network and the internet.
- [USB wireless dongle](../configuration/wireless/README.md)
    - Alternatively, you can connect to a wireless network using a USB wireless dongle, which will require configuration.
- Audio lead
    - Audio can be played through speakers or headphones using a standard 3.5mm jack.
    - Without an HDMI cable, an audio lead is necessary to produce sound.
    - No separate audio lead is necessary if you're using an HDMI cable to connect to a monitor with speakers, as audio can be played directly through the display; but it is possible to connect one if you prefer to have the audio played through other speakers - this requires [configuration](../configuration/audio-config.md).

## Troubleshooting

For any issues during setup, search [the forums](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/) for a solution. If you cannot find one, please post your problem, providing as much detail as possible.
