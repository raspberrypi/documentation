# NOOBS

**Note: We now recommend that you use [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) to install an operating system, instead of using NOOBS. If you are buying an SD card with software pre-installed on it, then we recommend buying one with NOOBS on it.**

**New Out Of Box Software (NOOBS)** is an operating system installation manager for the Raspberry Pi.

## How to get NOOBS

### Buy a pre-installed SD card

SD cards with NOOBS pre-installed are available from many of our distributors and independent retailers, including [Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/noobs-8gb-sd-card), [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1583), and [Pi Hut](http://thepihut.com/collections/raspberry-pi-sd-cards-and-adapters/products/noobs-preinstalled-sd-card).

## What's included in NOOBS

NOOBS includes Raspberry Pi OS, and LibreELEC which is a Kodi media player system. It can also be used to install other operating systems: this requires that the Pi has a working internet connection to download the OS.
