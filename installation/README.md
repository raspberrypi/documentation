Some simple guides to setting up the software on your Raspberry Pi.

Beginners should start with [NOOBS](noobs.md), which gives the user a choice of operating system from the standard distributions. The recommended distribution for normal use is Raspberry Pi OS. Alternatives are available, such as LibreELEC (Kodi media centre) or Arch Linux.
