# Installation

We recommend using [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) to install an operating system on your Raspberry Pi. As well as Raspberry Pi OS, you can use it to install other operating systems such as Ubuntu or LibreELEC (Kodi media centre).

* You can find detailed help with installing OS images [here](installing-images/). For further assistance, check out our [forums](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/).
