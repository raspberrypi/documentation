Raspberry Pi offers the following high-quality, reliable USB accessories for use with Raspberry Pi and other computers:

* Raspberry Pi <<hub>> for expanding USB connectivity.
* Raspberry Pi <<flashdrive>> for portable storage.

[[hub]]
== USB 3 Hub

The Raspberry Pi USB 3 Hub provides extra connectivity to your devices by extending one USB-A port into four USB-A ports. Devices connected through the USB 3 Hub are recognised as if they were connected directly to the host system, whether that's a Raspberry Pi device or other computers.

When bus-powered, the USB 3 Hub can draw up to 900 mA (4.5 W) of power from its upstream USB port. This 4.5 W is shared across all four downstream USB 3.0 ports, which is sufficient for low-power peripherals, such as most mice and keyboards.

To support high-power peripherals and devices, the USB 3 Hub also includes an optional USB-C power input that can be used to provide external power to the downstream ports if needed.

[[flashdrive]]
== Flash Drive

The Raspberry Pi Flash Drive is a USB 3.0 memory stick that provides portable storage for transferring files, creating backups, or running operating systems. The Flash Drive is available in two storage capacities (128 GB or 256 GB) and uses non-volatile flash memory to retain data when disconnected.

=== Flash Drive features

The Raspberry Pi Flash Drive is lightweight and travel-friendly, with a compact, metal design that can attach to a keyring or lanyard. It provides portable storage with reliable performance for both capacity options, and is compatible with USB 3.0 and USB 2.0. Key specifications related to these features are summarised in the following table.
