== Raspberry Pi Touch Display

The https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-touch-display/[Raspberry Pi Touch Display] is an LCD display which connects to the Raspberry Pi through the DSI connector. In recent versions of Raspberry Pi OS, both the HDMI and LCD display outputs can be used at the same time.

=== Board Support

The DSI display is designed to work with all models of Raspberry Pi, however early models that do not have mounting holes (the Raspberry Pi 1 Model A and B) will require additional mounting hardware to fit the HAT-dimensioned stand-offs on the display PCB.

=== Connecting a Raspberry Pi

The following image shows how to attach a Raspberry Pi to the back of the Touch Display using the included standoffs. It also shows the connections you need to make between Raspberry Pi and the display's PCB. You can also mount the touch display in a separate chassis if you have one available. The connections remain the same, though you may need longer cables depending on the chassis you use.

Connect one end of the ribbon cable to the `RPI-DISPLAY` port on the Touch Display PCB (make sure the blue stripe faces the PCB) and then connect the other end to the `DISPLAY` port on the Raspberry Pi (the blue stripe should face outwards).

==== Powering the Touch Display

There are two options to power the Touch Display: using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO to send power, or powering the display directly with a separate micro USB cable. 

WARNING: If you use a micro USB cable to power the display it must be mounted inside a chassis to reduce the risk of electrocution. The chassis also must block access to the display's PCB while its in use.

The following instructions are only relevant if you're using the Raspberry Pi for power. Do not make these connections when powering the display through its micro USB port.

Make sure the Raspberry Pi is powered off and unplugged, then connect one end of the black jumper wire to pin six (GND) on the Raspberry Pi and one end of the red jumper wire to pin four (5V). Next, connect the other end of the black wire to the GND pin on the display and the other end of the red wire to the 5V pin on the display.

The other three pins on the Touch Display are used to connect the display to an original Raspberry Pi 1 Model A or B. Refer to our documentation on xref:display.adoc#legacy-support[legacy support] for more information.

NOTE: An original Raspberry Pi can be easily identified from other models, it is the only model with a 26-pin rather than 40-pin GPIO header connector.

=== Screen Orientation

LCD displays have an optimum viewing angle, and depending on how the screen is mounted it may be necessary to change the orientation of the display to give the best results. By default, the Raspberry Pi Touch Display and Raspberry Pi are set up to work best when viewed from slightly above, for example on a desktop. If viewing from below, you can physically rotate the display, and then tell the system software to compensate by running the screen upside down.

To set screen orientation when running the graphical desktop, select the `Screen Configuration` option from the `Preferences` menu. Right click on the DSI display rectangle in the layout editor, select Orientation then the required option.

To set screen orientation when in console mode, you will need to edit the kernel command line to pass the required orientation to the system.

[,bash]
----
sudo nano /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt
----

To rotate by 90 degrees clockwise, add the following to the cmdline, making sure everything is on the same line, do not add any carriage returns. Possible rotation values are 0, 90, 180 and 270.

----
video=DSI-1:800x480@60,rotate=90
----

NOTE: In console mode it is not possible to rotate the DSI display separately to the HDMI display, so if you have both attached they must both be set to the same rotation value.

=== Touchscreen Orientation

Additionally, you have the option to change the rotation of the touchscreen independently of the display itself by adding a `dtoverlay` instruction in `config.txt`, for example:

`dtoverlay=rpi-ft5406,touchscreen-swapped-x-y=1,touchscreen-inverted-x=1`

The options for the touchscreen are:

|===
| DT parameter | Action

| touchscreen-size-x
| Sets X resolution (default 800)

| touchscreen-size-y
| Sets Y resolution (default 600)

| touchscreen-inverted-x
| Invert X coordinates

| touchscreen-inverted-y
| Invert Y coordinates

| touchscreen-swapped-x-y
| Swap X and Y coordinates
