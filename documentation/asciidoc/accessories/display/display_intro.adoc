== Raspberry Pi Touch Display

The https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-touch-display/[Raspberry Pi Touch Display] is an LCD display which connects to the Raspberry Pi through the DSI connector. In recent versions of Raspberry Pi OS, both the HDMI and LCD display outputs can be used at the same time.

=== Board Support

The DSI display is designed to work with all models of Raspberry Pi, however early models that do not have mounting holes (the Raspberry Pi 1 Model A and B) will require additional mounting hardware to fit the HAT-dimensioned stand-offs on the display PCB.

=== Physical Installation

The following image shows how to attach the Raspberry Pi to the back of the Touch Display (if required), and how to connect both the data (ribbon cable) and power (red/black wires) from the Raspberry Pi to the display. If you are not attaching the Raspberry Pi to the back of the display, take extra care when attaching the ribbon cable to ensure it is the correct way round. The black and red power wires should be attached to the GND and 5V pins respectively.

The other three pins should be left disconnected, unless connecting the display to an original Raspberry Pi 1 Model A or B. See the section on xref:display.adoc#legacy-support[legacy support] for more information on connecting the display to an original Raspberry Pi.

NOTE: An original Raspberry Pi can be easily identified from other models, it is the only model with a 26-pin rather than 40-pin GPIO header connector.

=== Screen Orientation

LCD displays have an optimum viewing angle, and depending on how the screen is mounted it may be necessary to change the orientation of the display to give the best results. By default, the Raspberry Pi Touch Display and Raspberry Pi are set up to work best when viewed from slightly above, for example on a desktop. If viewing from below, you can physically rotate the display, and then tell the system software to compensate by running the screen upside down.

To set screen orientation when running the graphical desktop, select the `Screen Configuration` option from the `Preferences` menu. Right click on the DSI display rectangle in the layout editor, select Orientation then the required option.

To set screen orientation when in console mode, you will need to edit the kernel command line to pass the required orientation to the system.

[,bash]
----
sudo nano /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt
----

To rotate by 90 degrees clockwise, add the following to the cmdline, making sure everything is on the same line, do not add any carriage returns. Possible rotation values are 0, 90, 180 and 270.

----
video=DSI-1:800x480@60,rotate=90
----

NOTE: In console mode it is not possible to rotate the DSI display separately to the HDMI display, so if you have both attached they must both be set to the same rotation value.

=== Touchscreen Orientation

Additionally, you have the option to change the rotation of the touchscreen independently of the display itself by adding a `dtoverlay` instruction in `config.txt`, for example:

`dtoverlay=rpi-ft5406,touchscreen-swapped-x-y=1,touchscreen-inverted-x=1`

The options for the touchscreen are:

|===
| DT parameter | Action

| touchscreen-size-x
| Sets X resolution (default 800)

| touchscreen-size-y
| Sets Y resolution (default 600)

| touchscreen-inverted-x
| Invert X coordinates

| touchscreen-inverted-y
| Invert Y coordinates

| touchscreen-swapped-x-y
| Swap X and Y coordinates
