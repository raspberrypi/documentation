== Legacy Support

NOTE: These instructions are for the original Raspberry Pi 1 Model A and B boards only. You can identify an original board as it is the only model with a 26-pin GPIO header, all other models have the now-standard 40-pin connector.

The DSI connector on the Raspberry Pi 1 Model A and B boards does not have the I2C connections required to talk to the touchscreen controller and DSI controller. You can work around this by using the additional set of jumper cables provided with the display kit to wire up the I2C bus on the GPIO pins to the display controller board.

Using the jumper cables, connect SCL/SDA on the GPIO header to the horizontal pins marked SCL/SDA on the display board. We also recommend that you power the Model A/B via the GPIO pins using the jumper cables.

For the GPIO header pinout, see http://pinout.xyz/[this diagram].

DSI display autodetection is disabled by default on these boards. To enable detection, add the following line to the xref:../computers/config_txt.adoc#what-is-config-txt[`/boot/firmware/config.txt`] file:

`ignore_lcd=0`

Power the setup via the `PWR IN` micro-USB connector on the display board. Do not power the setup via the Raspberry Pi's micro-USB port: the input polyfuse's maximum current rating will be exceeded as the display consumes approximately 400mA.
