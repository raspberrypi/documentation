== Updating your firmware

Raspberry Pi Audio Boards use an EEPROM that contains information that is used by the host Raspberry Pi device to select the appropriate driver at boot time. This information is programmed into the EEPROM during manufacture. There are some circumstances where the end user may wish to update the EEPROM contents, this can be done from the command line.

IMPORTANT: Before proceeding you should update the Raspberry Pi OS running on your Raspberry Pi to the latest version.

=== The EEPROM write-protect link

During the programming process you will need to connect the two pads shown in the red box with a wire to "pull down" the EEPROM write-protect link.

NOTE: In some cases the two pads may already have a 0Ω resistor fitted to bridge the write-protect link, as illustrated in the picture of the Codec Zero board above.

=== EEPROM Programming

Once the write protect line has been pulled down, the EEPROM can be programmed. 

You should first install the utilites and then run the programmer. Open up a terminal window and type the following.

----
$ sudo apt install iqaudio-utils
$ sudo iqaudio-program
----

After starting you will be presented with a warning screen.

Selecting "Yes" to proceed will present you with a menu allowing to select your hardware.

NOTE: If not HAT is present, or the connected HAT is not a Raspberry Pi Audio board you will be presented with an error screen. Alternatively if the firmware has already been updated on the board a message will be displayed informing you that you do not have to continue.

After selecting the correct hardware a screen will display during flashing.

Afterwards a screen will display telling you that the new firmware has been successfully flashed to the HAT.

NOTE: If the firmware fails to flash correct an error screen will be displayed. In the first intance you should remove and reseat the HAT board and try flashing the firmware again.
