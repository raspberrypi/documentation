NOTE: Board dimensions and mounting-hole positions for Camera Module 3 are identical to Camera Module 2. However, due to changes in the size and position of the sensor module, it isn't mechanically compatible with the camera lid for the Raspberry Pi Zero case.

In addition, the following figure shows the schematic for the Raspberry Pi CSI camera connector.

=== Pinout information

Use the information in this section to understand the function of the pins in the camera connectors.

==== Locating pin 1

The location of pin 1 on an FPC connector depends on the hardware.

The following descriptions assume you're holding your Raspberry Pi board with the chip and connectors facing up and the Raspberry Pi logo in the correct orientation. For Raspberry Pi Zero boards without the logo on the top side, orient the board with the GPIO along the edge furthest away from you.

** On Raspberry Pi flagship models and Raspberry Pi Zero devices, pin 1 is the pin furthest from you and closest to the GPIO header.
** On Raspberry Pi Compute Module IO boards, pin 1 is marked with a small circle or dot depending on the model.

When holding the Raspberry Pi camera board with the lens facing down and the connector facing to your right, pin 1 is the pin closest to you.

==== Camera connector pinout (15-Pin)

This is the pinout of the 15-pin Camera Serial Interface (CSI) connector used on flagship Raspberry Pi models prior to Raspberry Pi 5.
The connector is compatible with Amphenol SFW15R-2STE1LF.

Signal direction is specified from the perspective of the Raspberry Pi board.
The I2C lines (SCL and SDA) are pulled up to 3.3 V on the Raspberry Pi board.

The function and direction of the GPIO lines depend on the specific Camera Module in use. Typically, `CAM_IO0` is used as an active-high power enable. Some products don't include `CAM_IO1`.

==== Camera connector pinout (22-Pin)

This is the pinout of the 22-pin Camera Serial Interface (CSI) connector used on the Raspberry Pi Zero series, the Compute Module IO boards, and flagship models since Raspberry Pi 5.
The connector is compatible with Amphenol F32Q-1A7H1-11022.

Signal direction is specified from the perspective of the Raspberry Pi board.
The I2C lines (SCL and SDA) are pulled up to 3.3 V on the Raspberry Pi board.

The function and direction of the GPIO lines depend on the specific Camera Module in use. Typically, `CAM_IO0` is used as an active-high power enable. Some products don't include `CAM_IO1`.
