== Camera Modules

There are several official Raspberry Pi camera modules. The original 5-megapixel model was https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/camera-board-available-for-sale/[released] in 2013, and an 8-megapixel https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-v2/[Camera Module v2] was https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/new-8-megapixel-camera-board-sale-25/[released] in 2016. For both iterations, there are visible light and https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/pi-noir-camera-v2/[infrared] versions. A 12-megapixel https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/[High Quality Camera] was https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/new-product-raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera-on-sale-now-at-50/[released] in 2020. There is no infrared version of the HQ Camera, however the xref:camera.adoc#raspberry-pi-hq-camera-filter-removal[IR Filter can be removed] if required.

=== Installing a Raspberry Pi camera

WARNING: Cameras are sensitive to static. Earth yourself prior to handling the PCB. A sink tap or similar should suffice if you don't have an earthing strap.

==== Connecting the Camera

The flex cable inserts into the connector labelled CAMERA on the Raspberry Pi, which is located between the Ethernet and HDMI ports. The cable must be inserted with the silver contacts facing the HDMI port. To open the connector, pull the tabs on the top of the connector upwards, then towards the Ethernet port. The flex cable should be inserted firmly into the connector, with care taken not to bend the flex at too acute an angle. To close the connector, push the top part of the connector towards the HDMI port and down, while holding the flex cable in place.

We have created a video to illustrate the process of connecting the camera. Although the video shows the original camera on the original Raspberry Pi 1, the principle is the same for all camera boards:

Depending on the model, the camera may come with a small piece of translucent blue plastic film covering the lens. This is only present to protect the lens while it is being mailed to you, and needs to be removed by gently peeling it off.

=== Preparing the Software

Before proceeding, we recommend ensuring that your kernel, GPU firmware and applications are all up to date. Please follow the instructions on xref:../computers/os.adoc#using-apt[keeping your operating system up to date].

Then, please follow the relevant setup instructions for the xref:../computers/camera_software.adoc#getting-started[libcamera] software stack.

=== HQ Camera IR Filter Transmission

The HQ Camera uses a Hoya CM500 infrared filter. Its transmission characteristics are as represented in the following graph.
