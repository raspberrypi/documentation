== Camera Modules

There are now several official Raspberry Pi camera modules. The original 5-megapixel model was https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/camera-board-available-for-sale/[released] in 2013, it was followed by an 8-megapixel https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-v2/[Camera Module 2] which was https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/new-8-megapixel-camera-board-sale-25/[released] in 2016. The latest camera model is the 12-megapixel https://raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-3/[Camera Module 3] which was https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/new-autofocus-camera-modules/[released] in 2023. The original 5MP device is no longer available from Raspberry Pi. 

All of these cameras come in visible light and infrared versions, while the Camera Module 3 also comes as a standard or wide FoV model for a total of four different variants.

Aditionally a 12-megapixel https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/[High Quality Camera] with CS- or M12-mount variants for use with external lenses was https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/new-product-raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera-on-sale-now-at-50/[released in 2020] and https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/new-autofocus-camera-modules/[2023] respectively. There is no infrared version of the HQ Camera, however the xref:camera.adoc#hq-camera-filter-removal[IR Filter can be removed] if required.

NOTE: Raspberry Pi Camera Modules are compatible with all Raspberry Pi computers with CSI connectors - that is, all models except Raspberry Pi 400 and the 2016 launch version of Zero.

=== Installing a Raspberry Pi camera

WARNING: Cameras are sensitive to static. Earth yourself prior to handling the PCB. A sink tap or similar should suffice if you don't have an earthing strap.

==== Connecting the Camera

The flex cable inserts into the connector labelled CAMERA on the Raspberry Pi, which is located between the Ethernet and HDMI ports. The cable must be inserted with the silver contacts facing the HDMI port. To open the connector, pull the tabs on the top of the connector upwards, then towards the Ethernet port. The flex cable should be inserted firmly into the connector, with care taken not to bend the flex at too acute an angle. To close the connector, push the top part of the connector towards the HDMI port and down, while holding the flex cable in place.

We have created a video to illustrate the process of connecting the camera. Although the video shows the original camera on the original Raspberry Pi 1, the principle is the same for all camera boards:

Depending on the model, the camera may come with a small piece of translucent blue plastic film covering the lens. This is only present to protect the lens while it is being mailed to you, and needs to be removed by gently peeling it off.

NOTE: There is additional documentation available around fitting the recommended https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/hq-camera/cs-mount-lens-guide.pdf[6mm] and https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/hq-camera/c-mount-lens-guide.pdf[16mm] lens to the HQ Camera.

=== Preparing the Software

Before proceeding, we recommend ensuring that your kernel, GPU firmware and applications are all up to date. Please follow the instructions on xref:../computers/os.adoc#using-apt[keeping your operating system up to date].

Then, please follow the relevant setup instructions for the xref:../computers/camera_software.adoc#getting-started[libcamera] software stack, and the https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/camera/picamera2-manual.pdf[Picamera2 Python library].
