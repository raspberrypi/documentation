== Camera Module 3

This https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-3/[12-megapixel camera] is built around the Sony IMX708 sensor with a resolution of 4608 × 2592 pixels. It has https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/new-autofocus-camera-modules/[powered autofocus] and can record an exposure time of up to 112 seconds.

 Camera Module 3 comes in the following variants:

* Standard, normal field of view (FoV)
* Standard, wide FoV
* NoIR, normal FoV
* NoIR, wide FoV

The standard variants capture visible light only; infrared light is filtered out. The NoIR variants don't have an infrared filter; they capture both visible light and infrared light. Use a NoIR camera with infrared lighting to see in the dark or use it with the included square of blue gel to monitor the health of green plants.

For detailed information about the hardware characteristics and capabilities of this camera, see the xref:../accessories/camera.adoc#hardware-specification[hardware specifications].

NOTE: There is https://github.com/raspberrypi/libcamera/issues/43[some evidence] to suggest that the Camera Module 3 might emit RFI at a harmonic of the CSI clock rate. This RFI is in a range to interfere with GPS L1 frequencies (1575 MHz). For details and proposed workarounds, see the https://github.com/raspberrypi/libcamera/issues/43[thread on Github].

=== Transmission characteristics

The IMX708 sensor in Camera Module 3 has the following spectral sensitivity characteristics.

// Do we need another one of these for the NoIR characteristics?
