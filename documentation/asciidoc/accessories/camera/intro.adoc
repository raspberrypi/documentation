== About the Camera Modules

There are several official Raspberry Pi camera modules.

- *Camera Module 1.* A 5-megapixel camera that came in standard (visible light) and NoIR (visible light plus infrared) versions with a standard field of view (FoV). This device is no longer available from Raspberry Pi.
- xref:../accessories/camera.adoc#camera-module-2[*Camera Module 2.*] A 8-megapixel camera available in standard and NoIR versions with a standard FoV.
- xref:../accessories/camera.adoc#camera-module-3[*Camera Module 3.*] A 12-megapixel camera available in standard and NoIR versions. Both the standard and NoIR versions come with standard and wide FoV for a total of four different variants.
- xref:../accessories/camera.adoc#hq-camera[*High Quality Camera.*] A 12-megapixel camera that comes with CS- or M12-mount variants for use with external lenses. This model is unavailable as a NoIR version.
- xref:../accessories/ai-camera.adoc[*AI Camera.*] A 12-megapixel camera that provides low-latency and high-performance AI capabilities to any camera application. Tight integration with xref:../computers/camera_software.adoc[Raspberry Pi's camera software stack] enables users to deploy their own neural network models with minimal effort. This model is unavailable as a NoIR version.
- xref:../accessories/camera.adoc#gs-camera[*Global Shutter Camera.*] A 1.5-megapixel camera that uses a global shutter mechanism. It captures light from every pixel in the scene at once and is ideal for fast-motion photography. It comes with a CS-mount for use with external lenses. This model is unavailable as a NoIR version.

To compare the hardware characteristics of these cameras, see the xref:../accessories/camera.adoc#hardware-specification[hardware specifications].

NOTE: Raspberry Pi Camera Modules are compatible with all Raspberry Pi computers with CSI connectors.

For information about the camera software, see the xref:../computers/camera_software.adoc[camera software documentation].
