== Model deployment

To deploy a new neural network model to the Raspberry Pi AI Camera, complete the following steps:

. Provide a floating-point neural network model (PyTorch or TensorFlow).
. Run the model through Edge-MDT (Edge AI Model Development Toolkit).
.. *Quantise* and compress the model so that it can run using the resources available on the IMX500 camera module.
.. *Convert* the compressed model to IMX500 format.
. Package the model into a firmware file that can be loaded at runtime onto the camera.

The first two steps will normally be performed on a more powerful computer such as a desktop or server. You must run the final packaging step on a Raspberry Pi.

=== Model creation

The creation of neural network models is beyond the scope of this guide. Existing models can be re-used, or new ones created using popular AI frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

For more information, see the official https://developer.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/en/raspberrypi-ai-camera[AITRIOS developer website].

=== Model compression and conversion

==== Edge-MDT installation

The Edge-MDT (Model Development Toolkit) software package installs all the tools required to quantise, compress, and convert models to run on your IMX500 device.

The Edge-MDT package takes a parameter to select between installing the PyTorch or TensorFlow version of the tools.

[tabs]
======
TensorFlow::
+
[source,console]
----
$ pip install edge-mdt[tf]
----
+
TIP: Always use the same version of TensorFlow you used to compress your model.

PyTorch::
+
[source,console]
----
$ pip install edge-mdt[pt]
----
======

If you need to install both packages, use two separate Python virtual environments. This prevents TensorFlow and PyTorch from causing conflicts with each other.

==== Model Optimization

Models are quantised and compressed using Sony's Model Compression Toolkit (MCT). This tool is automatically installed as part of the Edge-MDT installation step. For more information, see the https://github.com/sony/model_optimization[Sony model optimization GitHub repository].

The Model Compression Toolkit generates a quantised model in the following formats:

* Keras (TensorFlow)
* ONNX (PyTorch)

=== Conversion

The converter is a command line application that compiles the quantised model (in .onnx or .keras formats) into a binary file that can be packaged and loaded onto the AI Camera. This tool is automatically installed as part of the Edge-MDT installation step.

To convert a model model:

[tabs]
======
TensorFlow::
+
[source,console]
----
$ imxconv-tf -i <compressed Keras model> -o <output folder>
----

PyTorch::
+
[source,console]
----
$ imxconv-pt -i <compressed ONNX model> -o <output folder>
----
======

IMPORTANT: For optimal use of the memory available to the accelerator on the IMX500 sensor, add `--no-input-persistency` to the above commands. However, this will disable input tensor generation that may be used for debugging purposes.

Both commands create an output folder that contains a memory usage report and a `packerOut.zip` file.

For more information on the model conversion process, see the official https://developer.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/en/raspberrypi-ai-camera/documentation/imx500-converter[Sony IMX500 Converter documentation].

=== Packaging

IMPORTANT: You must run this step on a Raspberry Pi.

The final step packages the model into an RPK file. When running the neural network model, we'll upload this file to the AI Camera. Before proceeding, run the following command to install the necessary tools:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt install imx500-tools
----

To package the model into an RPK file, run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ imx500-package -i <path to packerOut.zip> -o <output folder>
----

This command should create a file named `network.rpk` in the output folder. You'll pass the name of this file to your IMX500 camera applications.
