== About

The Raspberry Pi AI Camera using the Sony IMX500 imaging sensor is a great way of adding low-latency and high-performance AI capabilities to any camera application. The tight integration with https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/camera_software.html[Raspberry Pi's camera software stack] allows users to deploy their own neural network models with minimal effort.

This tutorial goes through the steps necessary for running either a pre-packaged or custom made neural network model on the camera. It also goes through the steps required for interperting the inference data generated by neural networks running on the IMX500 in https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpicam-apps[`rpicam-apps`] and https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2[`Picamera2`].
