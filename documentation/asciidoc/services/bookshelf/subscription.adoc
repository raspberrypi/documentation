== Become a contributor (Raspberry Pi OS Trixie and later)

Contributor-only titles are available to users who are signed in to Bookshelf with a xref:../services/id.adoc[Raspberry Pi ID] that's associated with one of the following things:

* An email address that has a https://raspberrypipress.imbmsubscriptions.com/[subscription to our print magazine]
* A https://magazine.raspberrypi.com/bookshelf/link[monthly contribution]

To set up a monthly contribution:

. In Bookshelf, select **Contribute...** in the bottom left to open the contributor page on the Raspberry Pi website.
. If you don't have a Raspberry Pi ID already, you can create one now. If you have an existing Raspberry Pi ID, sign in with your username and password.
. Sign up for a monthly contribution.
. Select **Sign in to Bookshelf** to open Bookshelf and store your ID that identifies you as a contributor.

The **Contribute...** button is no longer shown and all titles can now be downloaded.

You can sign in with your Raspberry Pi ID and access available titles from any number of devices. If you move to a new Raspberry Pi or flash your SD with a different version of Raspberry Pi OS, sign in and download your favourite titles again.

== Download titles

Double-click on any of the available titles to download them as a PDF and open them in the default PDF reader.

If you stop your monthly contribution, you keep any titles that you've already downloaded. These PDF files are stored in the **Bookshelf** folder of your home directory and remain accessible through Bookshelf.
