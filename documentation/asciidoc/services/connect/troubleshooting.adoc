== Troubleshooting

=== Known issues

* Screen sharing only supports sharing a single, primary display of your Raspberry Pi. When a Raspberry Pi is connected to multiple HDMI screens, Connect sometimes shares the contents of the secondary screen. You can work around this by right-clicking the desktop and changing the location of the taskbar in **Desktop Preferences...**.

* Connect does not support on-screen keyboards. For full functionality, use a physical keyboard.

* Connect requires a browser that implements https://caniuse.com/?search=es2020[ECMAScript 2020] (ES11) as it makes use of https://caniuse.com/?feats=mdn-javascript_operators_optional_chaining,mdn-javascript_operators_nullish_coalescing,mdn-javascript_builtins_globalthis,es6-module-dynamic-import,bigint,mdn-javascript_builtins_promise_allsettled,mdn-javascript_builtins_string_matchall,mdn-javascript_statements_export_namespace,mdn-javascript_operators_import_meta[features] unavailable in older browsers.

* Browsers intercept certain keys and key combinations. As a result, you can't type these keys into your Connect window. Screen sharing includes a toolbar to simulate some of the most popular intercepted keys.

=== View Connect status

To view the current status of the Connect service, run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ rpi-connect status
----

The output of this command indicates whether or not you are currently signed in to Connect, as well as the remote services enabled on your Raspberry Pi.

=== Enable enhanced logging

You can enable debug logging for both `rpi-connect` and its dedicated WayVNC server for a detailed account of local operations on your Raspberry Pi.

==== Enable enhanced logging in `rpi-connect`

Open the `rpi-connect` configuration file for editing with the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ systemctl --user edit rpi-connect
----

Enter the following lines of configuration between the comments:

[source,bash]
----
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/rpi-connectd -socket %t/rpi-connect-wayvnc.sock -v
----

NOTE: You need **both** lines that begin with `ExecStart=`.

Finally, restart the service with the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ systemctl --user restart rpi-connect
----

==== Use Raspberry Pi Connect with Tailscale ====

Due to how Tailscale affects networking, if you use both Raspberry Pi Connect and Tailscale, you may face issues using screen sharing, chances are you will see an empty screen. To fix this, you can use Raspberry Pi Connect in mDNS mode. This can be accomplished by editing Raspberry Pi Connect's systemd unit file.

To do this, open the `rpi-connect` configuration file for editing with the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ systemctl --user edit rpi-connect-wayvnc
----

Enter the following lines of configuration between the comments:

[source,bash]
----
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/rpi-connectd -socket %t/rpi-connect-wayvnc.sock -mdns
----

NOTE: You need **both** lines that begin with `ExecStart=`.

Finally, restart the service with the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ systemctl --user restart rpi-connect-wayvnc
----

Now Screen Sharing should be working perfectly with Tailscale running.

==== Enable enhanced logging in the dedicated `wayvnc` server

Open the configuration file for the dedicated WayVNC server associated with Connect:

[source,console]
----
$ systemctl --user edit rpi-connect-wayvnc
----

Enter the following lines of configuration between the comments:

[source,bash]
----
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/rpi-connect-env /usr/bin/wayvnc --config /etc/rpi-connect/wayvnc.config --render-cursor --unix-socket --socket=%t/rpi-connect-wayvnc-ctl.sock -Ldebug %t/rpi-connect-wayvnc.sock
----

NOTE: You need **both** lines that begin with `ExecStart=`.

Finally, restart the service with the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ systemctl --user restart rpi-connect-wayvnc
----

=== View Connect logs

To view logs for the Connect service and its dedicated WayVNC server, run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ journalctl --user --follow --unit rpi-connect --unit rpi-connect-wayvnc
----
