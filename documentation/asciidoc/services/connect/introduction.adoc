Connect is installed by default in Raspberry Pi OS Desktop and Raspberry Pi OS Full (desktop with recommended software). Raspberry Pi OS Lite doesn't include Connect by default, but you can xref:connect.adoc#install-connect-lite[install Connect Lite].

To use Connect, xref:connect.adoc#link-connect[link your device with an account] on your Raspberry Pi. Visit https://connect.raspberrypi.com[connect.raspberrypi.com] to access the desktop or a shell running on your Raspberry Pi in a browser window.

Connect uses a secure, encrypted connection. By default, Connect communicates directly between your Raspberry Pi and your browser. However, when Connect can't establish a direct connection between your Raspberry Pi and your browser, we use a relay server. In such cases, Raspberry Pi only retains the metadata required to operate Connect.

NOTE: To use Connect, your Raspberry Pi must run https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/bookworm-the-new-version-of-raspberry-pi-os/[Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm] or later.
