To use Connect, xref:connect.adoc#install-connect[install the Connect software] and xref:connect.adoc#link-connect[link your device with an account] on your Raspberry Pi. Then visit https://connect.raspberrypi.com[connect.raspberrypi.com] to access the desktop or a shell running on your Raspberry Pi in a browser window.

Connect uses a secure, encrypted connection. By default, Connect communicates directly between your Raspberry Pi and your browser. However, when Connect can't establish a direct connection between your Raspberry Pi and your browser, we use a relay server. In such cases, Raspberry Pi only retains the metadata required to operate Connect.

NOTE: To use Connect, your Raspberry Pi must run https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/bookworm-the-new-version-of-raspberry-pi-os/[Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm] or later.
