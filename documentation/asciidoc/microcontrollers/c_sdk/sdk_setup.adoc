== SDK Setup

For a full walk-through of how to get going with the C/{cpp} SDK, read our https://pip.raspberrypi.com/documents/RP-008276-DS[getting started] documentation. However, if you are intending to develop for Pico on a xref:../computers/os.adoc[Raspberry Pi], then you can set up the C/{cpp} toolchain quickly by running our https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raspberrypi/pico-setup/master/pico_setup.sh[setup script] from the command line.

NOTE: You should make sure the OS on your Raspberry Pi is xref:../computers/os.adoc#update-software[up to date] before running the setup script.
