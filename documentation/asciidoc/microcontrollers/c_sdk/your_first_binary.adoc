== Your First Binaries

WARNING: If you are using an Apple Mac, and running macOS Ventura, there has been a change in how the Finder works which causes drag-and-drop to fail. Please see our https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/the-ventura-problem/[blog post] for a full explanation, and workarounds, and our https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/issues/1081[Github issue] tracking the problem for the current status.

=== Blink an LED

The first program anyone writes when using a new microcontroller is to blink an LED on and off. The Raspberry Pi Pico comes with a single LED on-board. The LED is connected to `GP25` on the board's Raspberry Pi RP2040 for Pico, and `WL_GPIO0` on the Infineon 43439 wireless chip for Pico W.

You can blink this on and off by,

. Download the Blink UF2 https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/soft/blink.uf2[for Raspberry Pi Pico], or https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/soft/blink_picow.uf2[for Pico W].
. Push and hold the BOOTSEL button and plug your Pico into the USB port of your Raspberry Pi or other computer.
. It will mount as a Mass Storage Device called RPI-RP2.
. Drag and drop the Blink UF2 binary onto the RPI-RP2 volume. Pico will reboot.

You should see the on-board LED blinking.

You can see the code on Github for the https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/blink/blink.c[Raspberry Pi Pico] and https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/pico_w/wifi/blink/picow_blink.c[Pico W] versions.

=== Say "Hello World"

The next program anyone writes is to say 'Hello World' over a USB serial connection.

. Download the https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/soft/hello_world.uf2['Hello World' UF2].
. Push and hold the BOOTSEL button and plug your Pico into the USB port of your Raspberry Pi or other computer.
. It will mount as a Mass Storage Device called RPI-RP2.
. Drag and drop the 'Hello World' UF2 binary onto the RPI-RP2 volume. Pico will reboot.
. Open a Terminal window and type:
+
[source]
------
sudo apt install minicom
minicom -b 115200 -o -D /dev/ttyACM0
------

You should see 'Hello, world!' printed to the Terminal.
