https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2040/hardware-design-with-rp2040.pdf[Hardware design with RP2040]:: Using RP2040 microcontrollers to build boards and products

=== Raspberry Pi Pico

https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/pico-datasheet.pdf[Raspberry Pi Pico Datasheet]:: An RP2040-based microcontroller board

https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf[Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico]:: C/{cpp} development with Raspberry Pi Pico and other RP2040-based microcontroller boards

=== Raspberry Pi Pico W

https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/picow/pico-w-datasheet.pdf[Raspberry Pi Pico W Datasheet]:: An RP2040-based microcontroller board with wireless

https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/picow/connecting-to-the-internet-with-pico-w.pdf[Connecting to the Internet with Raspberry Pi Pico W]:: Getting Raspberry Pi Pico W online with C/{cpp} or MicroPython

NOTE: Code compiled for the Pico may not work on the Pico W! Especially the onboard LED, which switches from (pin 25 on pico to pin 00 on W) Documentation introducing working with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on Raspberry Pi Pico W with C/{cpp} or MicroPython is presented in the https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/picow/connecting-to-the-internet-with-pico-w.pdf[Connecting to the Internet with Raspberry Pi Pico W] book.

=== Software Development

https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-c-sdk.pdf[Raspberry Pi Pico C/{cpp} SDK]:: Libraries and tools for C/{cpp} development on RP2040 microcontrollers

https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-python-sdk.pdf[Raspberry Pi Pico Python SDK]:: A MicroPython environment for RP2040 microcontrollers

The API level Doxygen documentation for the Raspberry Pi Pico C/{cpp} SDK is also available https://rptl.io/pico-doxygen[as a micro-site].

NOTE: A https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-setup-windows/releases/latest/download/pico-setup-windows-x64-standalone.exe[one-click installer] for the Pico C/{cpp} SDK for Windows 10 and Windows 11 is available.
