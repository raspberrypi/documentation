* Pico
* Pico H
* Pico W
* Pico WH

The second-generation Raspberry Pi Pico family is referred to as Pico 2. Pico 2 comes in the following variants:

=== Raspberry Pi Pico 2

Raspberry Pi Pico 2 is a low-cost, high-performance microcontroller board with flexible digital interfaces. Key features include:

* xref:silicon.adoc#rp2350[RP2350] microcontroller chip designed by Raspberry Pi in the United Kingdom
* Dual Cortex-M33 or Hazard3 processors at up to 150 MHz
* 520 kB of SRAM, and 4 MB of on-board flash memory
* USB 1.1 with device and host support
* Low-power sleep and dormant modes
* Drag-and-drop programming using mass storage over USB
* 26× multi-function GPIO pins including 3 that can be used for ADC
* 2× SPI, 2× I2C, 2× UART, 3× 12-bit 500 ksps Analogue to Digital Converter (ADC), 24× controllable PWM channels
* 2× Timer with 4 alarms, 1× AON Timer
* Temperature sensor
* 3 × Programmable IO (PIO) blocks, 12 state machines total for custom peripheral support
** Flexible, user-programmable high-speed IO
** Can emulate interfaces such as SD Card and VGA

The Raspberry Pi Pico 2 comes as a castellated module which allows soldering direct to carrier boards, while the Pico 2 _with headers_ comes with pre-soldered headers.

NOTE: Both boards have a three pin Serial Wire Debug (SWD) header. However, the Pico 2 with headers breaks this out into a small, keyed, https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/debug/debug-connector-specification.pdf[3-pin connector] while the Pico has three castellated through-hole pins adjacent to the edge of the board.

=== Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W

Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W adds on-board single-band 2.4 GHz wireless interfaces (802.11n) using the Infineon CYW43439 to the Pico 2 hardware. The on-board 2.4 GHz wireless interface has the following features:

* Wireless (802.11n), single-band (2.4 GHz)
* WPA3
* Soft access point supporting up to four clients
* Bluetooth 5.2
** Support for Bluetooth LE Central and Peripheral roles
** Support for Bluetooth Classic

The onboard antenna is licensed from ABRACON (formerly ProAnt). The wireless interface is connected via
SPI to the xref:silicon.adoc#rp2350[RP2350] microcontroller.

Due to pin limitations, some of the wireless interface pins are shared. The CLK is shared with VSYS monitor, so only
when there isn't an SPI transaction in progress can VSYS be read via the ADC. The Infineon CYW43439 DIN/DOUT and
IRQ all share one pin on the RP2350. Only when an SPI transaction isn't in progress is it suitable to check for IRQs. The interface typically runs at 33 MHz.

For best wireless performance, position the antenna in free space. For instance, metal underneath or nearby the
antenna can reduce performance both in terms of gain and bandwidth. Adding grounded metal to the sides of the
antenna can improve the antenna's bandwidth.

`libcyw43` is licensed for non-commercial use. However, Pico 2 W users, and anyone else who builds their product around RP2350 and CYW43439, benefit from a free https://github.com/georgerobotics/cyw43-driver/blob/195dfcc10bb6f379e3dea45147590db2203d3c7b/LICENSE.RP[commercial-use license].

* WPA3
* Soft access point supporting up to four clients
* Bluetooth 5.2
