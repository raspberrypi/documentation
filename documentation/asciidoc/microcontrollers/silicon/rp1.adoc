RP1 is a 12×12 mm, 0.65 mm-pitch BGA southbridge, which provides the majority of the I/O capabilities for Raspberry Pi 5.

It provides:

* 4-lane PCIe 2.0 endpoint
* Gigabit Ethernet MAC
* 2× USB 3 host controllers
** Each has 1× USB 3 and 1× USB 2 port
** More than twice the usable USB bandwidth vs. Raspberry Pi 4
* 2× SDIO ports/eMMC (not used on Raspberry Pi 5)
* 2× MIPI transceivers (4-lane, supporting DSI and CSI-2)
* Video DAC (3-channel, supporting PAL/NTSC and VGA)
** Only one channel (composite) used on Raspberry Pi 5
* Low-speed peripherals (SPI, UART, I2C, PWM, GPIO, I2S)
* Delta-sigma PWM audio out
