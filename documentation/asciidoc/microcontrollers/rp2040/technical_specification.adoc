== Technical Specification

RP2040 is the debut microcontroller from Raspberry Pi. It brings our signature values of high performance, low cost, and ease of use to the microcontroller space.

With a large on-chip memory, symmetric dual-core processor complex, deterministic bus fabric, and rich peripheral set augmented with our unique Programmable I/O (PIO) subsystem, it provides professional users with unrivalled power and flexibility. With detailed documentation, a polished MicroPython port, and a UF2 bootloader in ROM, it has the lowest possible barrier to entry for beginner and hobbyist users.

RP2040 is a stateless device, with support for cached execute-in-place from external QSPI memory. This design decision allows you to choose the appropriate density of non-volatile storage for your application, and to benefit from the low pricing of commodity Flash parts.

RP2040 is manufactured on a modern 40nm process node, delivering high performance, low dynamic power consumption, and low leakage, with a variety of low-power modes to support extended-duration operation on battery power.

Key features:

* Dual ARM Cortex-M0+ @ 133MHz
* 264kB on-chip SRAM in six independent banks
* Support for up to 16MB of off-chip Flash memory via dedicated QSPI bus
* DMA controller
* Fully-connected AHB crossbar
* Interpolator and integer divider peripherals
* On-chip programmable LDO to generate core voltage
* 2 on-chip PLLs to generate USB and core clocks
* 30 GPIO pins, 4 of which can be used as analogue inputs
* Peripherals
** 2 UARTs
** 2 SPI controllers
** 2 I2C controllers
** 16 PWM channels
** USB 1.1 controller and PHY, with host and device support
** 8 PIO state machines

=== Why is the chip called RP2040?

The post-fix numeral on RP2040 comes from the following,

. Number of processor cores (2)
. Loosely which type of processor (M0+)
. floor(log2(ram / 16k))
. floor(log2(nonvolatile / 16k)) or 0 if no onboard nonvolatile storage
