== RP2040-based Boards

Designed by Raspberry Pi as both a development board, and as a reference design, the xref:raspberry-pi-pico.adoc[Raspberry Pi Pico] series is a family of RP2040-based boards. The Pico family currently consists of Raspberry Pi Pico (far left), Pico H (left), Pico W (right), and Pico WH (far right).

==== USB PIDs

Many RP2040-based devices use Raspberry Pi's USB Vendor ID and Product ID combination. If you build a third-party board based on RP2040, you may require a unique USB Product ID (PID).

You might need a unique USB PID if you need to provide a custom driver for Windows users.

USB-IF have given Raspberry Pi permission to license USB product ID values for its Vendor ID (`0x2E8A`) for common silicon components used with RP2040.

To reserve a USB PID associated with Raspberry Pi's vendor ID, follow the instructions found at the https://github.com/raspberrypi/usb-pid[Raspberry Pi USB PID git repository].

NOTE: If you use the standard RP2040 PID, you can use the `iManufacturer`, `iProduct`, and `iSerial` strings to uniquely identify your device.
