== Updating the firmware on the Debug Probe

Firmware for the Debug Probe is available as a UF2 file distributed by Raspberry Pi.

The latest version of the Debug Probe firmware is version 2.2. If you're running an older version, or if you have accidentally overwritten the firmware on your Debug Probe, you can find the latest release of the firmware in https://github.com/raspberrypi/debugprobe/releases/latest[the debugprobe GitHub repository].

Download `debugprobe.uf2` from the latest release.

Pinch to remove the top of the Debug Probe enclosure.

Push and hold the BOOTSEL button as you plug the Debug Probe into your computer to mount a volume called "RPI-RP2".

Copy `debugprobe.uf2` onto the "RPI-RP2" volume. The volume will dismount automatically after the file finishes copying onto the device.

Your Debug Probe will reboot and now runs an updated version of the Debug Probe firmware. It is now ready for debugging.
