Depending on your setup, there are several ways to wire the Debug Probe to a xref:raspberry-pi-pico.adoc[Raspberry Pi Pico]. Below, we connect the Debug Probe to a Raspberry Pi Pico H which has the newer three-pin JST connector for SWD.

Here we have connected:

* The Debug Probe "D" connector to Pico H SWD JST connector
* The Debug Probe "U" connector has the three-pin JST connector to 0.1-inch header 
** Debug Probe RX connected to Pico H TX pin
** Debug Probe TX connected to Pico H RX pin
** Debug Probe GND connected to Pico H GND pin
