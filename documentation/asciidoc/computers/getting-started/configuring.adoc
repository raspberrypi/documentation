== Initial setup and configuration

When you start your Raspberry Pi for the first time after installing an operating system, a configuration wizard will guide you through the system's initial setup.

NOTE: This wizard will not run if you used the xref:getting-started.adoc#advanced-options[Advanced options menu] of Raspberry Pi Imager to configure the operating system.

=== Set up Bluetooth devices

If you're using a Bluetooth keyboard or mouse, it will tell you to put each device into pairing mode. While on this page, the Raspberry Pi will scan for pairable devices and connect to the first device it finds for each item. Your devices are ready to use when you see the `connected` dialog.

This process works with the built-in Bluetooth adapter on Raspberry Pi 3 and 4, and with USB Bluetooth adapters on earlier models. Make sure any adapters you want to use are plugged in before powering on your Raspberry Pi.

=== Set country

This page lets you set your country, language, and timezone. You can also select the a specific keyboard layout.

=== Create user

.The Create User dialog.

Before you can continue, you need to set the username and password for the default user account.

While you can set your username to the old default username of `pi` — used on older versions of Raspberry Pi OS — you will trigger a warning message. If you decide to continue, we recommend you avoid the old default password of `raspberry`.

.A warning appears if the default password is used.

WARNING: If you are installing Raspberry Pi OS Lite you must create a new user account using the command line when you first boot a Lite image. If you are booting Raspberry Pi OS xref:configuration.adoc#setting-up-a-headless-raspberry-pi[headless] you *MUST* configure the operating system using Raspberry Pi Imager using the xref:getting-started.adoc#advanced-options[Advanced Menu].

=== Set up your desktop

.The Set Up Screen dialog.

Here you can manually resize the desktop if it doesn't look correct on your display device.

=== Select a wireless network

.The Select Wireless Network dialog.

Your Raspberry Pi will scan for nearby WiFi access points. You can choose which network to connect to from this list. 

=== Check for software updates

.The Update Software dialog.

Once your Raspberry Pi has internet access you can update the operating system to the latest version. This will automatically download any patches and updates needed to for your operating system.

=== Finish

At the end of the configuration wizard, you will need to reboot your Raspberry Pi to apply the new configuration and launch to desktop.

.When setup completes, click Restart to restart your Raspberry Pi.
