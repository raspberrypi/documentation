== Powering Raspberry Pi 5

Raspberry Pi manufactures two different USB-C power supplies. 

The first is the Raspberry Pi 15W USB-C Power Supply, which is the recommended supply for Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry Pi 400. The second is the Raspberry Pi 27W USB-C Power Supply, which provides up to 5A current at +5.1V, and is the recommended supply for Raspberry Pi 5.

The USB-C standard, used by the Raspberry Pi 4 supply, is limited to 5V at 3A, for a total power output of 15W. The USB-PD standard allows higher voltages and currents to be negotiated via software but requires an appropriate Power Management Integrated Circuit (PMIC) which is only present on Raspberry Pi 5. These supplies require that you use suitable USB-PD compatible cables. 

NOTE: It's not possible to use older USB "dumb" cables and connectors to provide more than 15W, even with a USB-PD capable supply.

While USB-PD capable phone chargers advertise greater than 15W of power, virtually all of them achieve this by increasing the voltage instead of providing more current at +5V. If you are using a power supply that cannot provide 5A at +5V on first boot you will be warned by the operating system that the current draw to peripherals will be restricted.

We recommend the official Raspberry Pi Power Supply, which has been designed to consistently provide +5V despite rapid fluctuations in current draw. Those fluctuations in demand are common and frequent when you’re using peripherals with the Raspberry Pi. Other power supplies — usually designed to provide consistent current for charging cellphones —  don’t cope with power fluctuations all that well. The official supply also has an attached (captive) USB cable, which means that you don’t accidentally use a poor-quality or "dumb" cable, which can be an issue with other supplies.

WARNING: If you are using a third-party USB-PD capable multi-port power supply, plugging an additional device into the supply as well as your Raspberry Pi will cause a renegotiation between the supply and the Raspberry Pi. This will happen seamlessly if the Raspberry Pi is powered, but if the Raspberry Pi is plugged in and powered down, this renegotiation may cause the Raspberry Pi to boot.

//NOTE: Raspberry Pi 5 makes use of the Renesas DA9091 “Gilmour” power-management IC (PMIC). This integrates eight separate switch-mode power supplies to generate the various voltages required by the board, including a quad-phase core supply, capable of providing 20A of current to power the Cortex-A76 cores and other digital logic in BCM2712.

=== USB boot and power supplies

By default, USB boot is not enabled with a 3A power supply. However, setting `usb_max_current_enable=1` in the `/boot/firmware/config.txt` file will override this and enable USB boot with a lower wattage power supply.

When booting using a 3A supply without this statement in the `config.txt`, a warning message is displayed on the bootloader HDMI diagnostics screen and the bootloader will skip to the next boot mode.

USB boot requires a high current (5V 5A) power supply.
To disable this check set usb_max_current_enable=1 in config.txt
or press the power button to temporarily enable usb_max_current_enable
and continue booting.

The bootloader will prompt you to "press power button to continue", which effectively sets `usb_max_current_enable=1` for the current boot temporarily to allow you to boot from USB. Unless your disk has its own external power supply it is possible that there may not be sufficient current available to your Raspberry Pi.

=== Power supplies and Raspberry Pi OS

The bootloader passes information about the powe supply via device-tree `/proc/device-tree/chosen/power`. Users will typically not read this directly.

max_current:: The max current in mA
uspd_power_data_objects:: A dump of the PDOs - debug for advanced users
usb_max_current_enable:: Whether the current limiter was set to high or low
usb_over_current_detected:: Whether any USB over current occured during boot before transferring control to the OS
reset_event:: The PMIC reset reason e.g. watchdog, over- or under-voltage, over-temperature

The PMIC has built-in ADCs that, among other things, can measure the supply voltage `EXT5V_V`.

NOTE: You can't see USB current or anything else connected directly to 5V because this bypasses the PMIC. You should not expect this to add up to the wattage of the source power supply. However, it can be useful to monitor things like the core voltage.
