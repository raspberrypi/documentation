Raspberry Pi 5 has an FPC connector on the right-hand side of the board. This connector breaks out PCIe Gen 2.0 x1 interface for fast peripherals. 

NOTE: An M.2 HAT which provides an M.2 connector to allow the use of NVMe drives is still in protoype, and has not yet been released.

NOTE: More information around the PCIe FPC connector pin out, and other details needed to create third-party devices, accessories, and HATs, will be released at a later point in time.

=== Enabling PCIe

By default the PCIe connector is not enabled. To enable it you should add the following option into `/boot/firmware/config.txt` and reboot:

[source]
----
# Enable the PCIe External connector.
dtparam=pciex1
----

A more memorable alias for `pciex1` exists, so you can alternatively add `dtparam=nvme` to the `/boot/firmware/config.txt` file.

NOTE: Enumeration of PCIe devices behind a switch is https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/1833[not currently supported].

=== PCIe Gen 3.0

The connection is certified for Gen 2.0 speeds (5 GT/sec), but you can force it to Gen 3.0 (10 GT/sec) if you add the following lines to your `/boot/firmware/config.txt`.

[source]
----
# Enable the PCIe external connector
dtparam=pciex1

# Force Gen 3.0 speeds
dtparam=pciex1_gen=3
----

WARNING: The Raspberry Pi 5 is not certified for Gen 3.0 speeds, and connections to PCIe devices at these speeds may be unstable.
