== Legacy Raspberry Pi 4 HDMI Pipeline

IMPORTANT: When using the VC4 KMS graphics driver, the complete display pipeline is managed by Linux - this includes the HDMI outputs. These settings only apply to the legacy FKMS and firmware-based graphics driver.

The Raspberry Pi 4 is unable to output over HDMI at 1366x768 @ 60Hz. On some monitors it is possible to configure them to use 1360x768 @ 60Hz. They typically do not advertise this mode via their EDID so the selection can't be made automatically, but it can be manually chosen by adding

hdmi_group=2
hdmi_mode=87
hdmi_cvt=1360 768 60

to xref:legacy_config_txt.adoc#legacy-video-options[config.txt].

Timings specified manually via a `hdmi_timings=` line in `config.txt` will also need to comply with the restriction of all horizontal timing parameters being divisible by 2.

`dpi_timings=` are not restricted in the same way as that pipeline still only runs at a single pixel per clock cycle.
