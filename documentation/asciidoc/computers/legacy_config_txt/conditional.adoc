=== The `[HDMI:*]` Filter

NOTE: This filter is for the Raspberry Pi 4 only.

The Raspberry Pi 4 has two HDMI ports, and for many `config.txt` commands related to HDMI, it is necessary to specify which HDMI port is being referred to. The HDMI conditional filters subsequent HDMI configurations to the specific port.

 [HDMI:0]

   hdmi_mode=45
 [HDMI:1]
   hdmi_group=2
   hdmi_mode=67

An alternative `variable:index` syntax is available on all port-specific HDMI commands. You could use the following, which is the same as the previous example:
