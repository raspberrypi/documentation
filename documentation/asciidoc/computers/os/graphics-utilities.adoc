== Useful Utilities

There are several useful command line utilities.

=== tvservice

`tvservice` is a command line application used to get and set information about the display, targeted mainly at HDMI video and audio.

Typing `tvservice` by itself will display a list of available command line options.

==== -p, --preferred

Power on the HDMI output with preferred settings.

==== -o, --off

Powers off the display output.

NOTE: Powering off the output using this command will also destroy any framebuffers/dispmanx layers associated with the display. These are NOT re-established with a subsequent power on, so will result in a blank screen.

A better option is to use the xref:os.adoc#vcgencmd[vcgencmd display_power] option, as this will retain any framebuffers, so when the power is turned back on the display will be the returned to the previous power on state.

==== -e, --explicit="Group Mode Drive"

Power on the HDMI with the specified settings

Group can be one of `CEA`, `DMT`, `CEA_3D_SBS`, `CEA_3D_TB`, `CEA_3D_FP`, `CEA_3D_FS`. +
Mode is one of the modes returned from the `-m, --modes` option. +
Drive can be one of `HDMI`, `DVI`.

==== -t, --ntsc

Use 59.94Hz (NTSC frequency) rather than 60Hz for HDMI mode.

==== -c, --sdtvon="Mode Aspect [P]"

Power on the SDTV (composite output) with the specified mode, `PAL` or `NTSC`, and the specified aspect, `4:3`, `14:9`, `16:9`. The optional `P` parameter can be used to specify progressive mode.

==== -m, --modes=Group

where Group is `CEA` or `DMT`.

Shows a list of display modes available in the specified group.

==== -M, --monitor

Monitors for any HDMI events, for example unplugging or attaching.

==== -s, --status

Shows the current settings for the display mode, including mode, resolution, and frequency.

==== -a, --audio

Shows the current settings for the audio mode, including channels, sample rate and sample size.

==== -d, --dumpid=filename

Save the current EDID to the specified filename. You can then use `edidparser <filename>` to display the data in a human readable form.

==== -j, --json

When used in combination with the `--modes` options, displays the mode information in JSON format.

==== -n, --name

Extracts the display name from the EDID data and shows it.

==== -l, --list

Lists all attached displays and their display ID.

==== -v, --device=display

Specifies the ID of the device to use; see the output of `--list` for available IDs.

=== vcgencmd

The `vcgencmd` tool is used to output information from the VideoCore GPU on the Raspberry Pi. You can find source code for the `vcgencmd` utility https://github.com/raspberrypi/userland/tree/master/host_applications/linux/apps/gencmd[on Github].

To get a list of all commands which `vcgencmd` supports, use `vcgencmd commands`. Some useful commands and their required parameters are listed below.

==== vcos

The `vcos` command has two useful sub-commands:

* `version` displays the build date and version of the firmware on the VideoCore
* `log status` displays the error log status of the various VideoCore firmware areas

==== version

Displays the build date and version of the VideoCore firmware.

==== get_throttled

Returns the throttled state of the system. This is a bit-pattern - a bit being set indicates the following meanings:

[cols="^,,"]
|===
| Bit | Hex value | Meaning

| 0
| 0x1
| Under-voltage detected

| 1
| 0x2
| Arm frequency capped

| 2
| 0x4
| Currently throttled

| 3
| 0x8
| Soft temperature limit active

| 16
| 0x10000
| Under-voltage has occurred

| 17
| 0x20000
| Arm frequency capping has occurred

| 18
| 0x40000
| Throttling has occurred

| 19
| 0x80000
| Soft temperature limit has occurred
|===

==== measure_temp

Returns the temperature of the SoC as measured by its internal temperature sensor;
on Raspberry Pi 4, `measure_temp pmic` returns the temperature of the PMIC.

==== measure_clock [clock]

This returns the current frequency of the specified clock. The options are:

[cols="^,"]
|===
| clock | Description

| arm
| ARM core(s)

| core
| GPU core

| h264
| H.264 block

| isp
| Image Sensor Pipeline

| v3d
| 3D block

| uart
| UART

| pwm
| PWM block (analogue audio output)

| emmc
| SD card interface

| pixel
| Pixel valves

| vec
| Analogue video encoder

| hdmi
| HDMI

| dpi
| Display Parallel Interface
|===

e.g. `vcgencmd measure_clock arm`

==== measure_volts [block]

Displays the current voltages used by the specific block.

[cols="^,"]
|===
| block | Description

| core
| VC4 core voltage

| sdram_c
| SDRAM Core Voltage

| sdram_i
| SDRAM I/O voltage

| sdram_p
| SDRAM Phy Voltage
|===

==== otp_dump

Displays the content of the OTP (one-time programmable) memory inside the SoC. These are 32-bit values, indexed from 8 to 64. See the xref:raspberry-pi.adoc#otp-register-and-bit-definitions[OTP bits page] for more details.

[[getconfig]]
==== get_config [configuration item|int|str]

Display value of the configuration setting specified: alternatively, specify either `int` (integer) or `str` (string) to see all configuration items of the given type. For example:

----
vcgencmd get_config total_mem
----

returns the total memory on the device in megabytes.

==== get_mem type

Reports on the amount of memory addressable by the ARM  and the GPU. To show the amount of ARM-addressable memory use `vcgencmd get_mem arm`; to show the amount of GPU-addressable memory use `vcgencmd get_mem gpu`. Note that on devices with more than 1GB of memory the `arm` parameter will always return 1GB minus the `gpu` memory value, since the GPU firmware is only aware of the first 1GB of memory. To get an accurate report of the total memory on the device, see the `total_mem` configuration item - see <<getconfig,`get_config`>> section above.

===== codec_enabled [type]

Reports whether the specified CODEC type is enabled. Possible options for type are AGIF, FLAC, H263, H264, MJPA, MJPB, MJPG, *MPG2*, MPG4, MVC0, PCM, THRA, VORB, VP6, VP8, *WMV9*, *WVC1*. Those highlighted currently require a paid for licence (see the xref:config_txt.adoc#licence-key-and-codec-options[this config.txt section] for more info), except on the Raspberry Pi 4 and 400, where these hardware codecs are disabled in preference to software decoding, which requires no licence. Note that because the H.265 HW block on the Raspberry Pi 4 and 400 is not part of the VideoCore GPU, its status is not accessed via this command.

===== get_lcd_info

Displays the resolution and colour depth of any attached display.

===== mem_oom

Displays statistics on any OOM (out of memory) events occurring in the VideoCore memory space.

===== mem_reloc_stats

Displays statistics from the relocatable memory allocator on the VideoCore.

===== read_ring_osc

Returns the current speed voltage and temperature of the ring oscillator.

===== hdmi_timings

Displays the current HDMI settings timings. See xref:config_txt.adoc#video-options[Video Config] for details of the values returned.

===== dispmanx_list

Dump a list of all dispmanx items currently being displayed.

===== display_power [0 | 1 | -1] [display]

Show current display power state, or set the display power state. `vcgencmd display_power 0` will turn off power to the current display. `vcgencmd display_power 1` will turn on power to the display. If no parameter is set, this will display the current power state. The final parameter is an optional display ID, as returned by `tvservice -l` or from the table below, which allows a specific display to be turned on or off.

Note that for the 7" Raspberry Pi Touch Display this simply turns the backlight on and off. The touch functionality continues to operate as normal.

`vcgencmd display_power 0 7` will turn off power to display ID 7, which is HDMI 1 on a Raspberry Pi 4.

|===
| Display | ID

| Main LCD
| 0

| Secondary LCD
| 1

| HDMI 0
| 2

| Composite
| 3

| HDMI 1
| 7
|===

To determine if a specific display ID is on or off, use -1 as the first parameter.

`vcgencmd display_power -1 7` will return 0 if display ID 7 is off, 1 if display ID 7 is on, or -1 if display ID 7 is in an unknown state, for example undetected.

=== vcdbg

`vcdbg` is an application to help with debugging the VideoCore GPU from Linux running on the ARM. It needs to be run as root. This application is mostly of use to Raspberry Pi engineers, although there are some commands that general users may find useful.

`sudo vcdbg help` will give a list of available commands.

NOTE: Only options of use to end users have been listed.

==== version

Shows various items of version information from the VideoCore.

==== log

Dumps logs from the specified subsystem. Possible options are:

|===
| log | Description

| msg
| Prints out the message log

| assert
| Prints out the assertion log

| ex
| Prints out the exception log

| info
| Prints out information from the logging headers

| level
| Sets the VCOS logging level for the specified category, n\|e\|w\|i\|t

| list
| List the VCOS logging levels
|===

e.g. To print out the current contents of the message log:

`vcdbg log msg`

==== malloc

List all memory allocations current in the VideoCore heap.

==== pools
