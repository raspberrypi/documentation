== Python on Raspberry Pi

Python 3 is installed by default on Raspberry Pi OS and is used for many important functions. Interfering with the system Python installation can therefore cause problems for your operating system, so it's important that if you install third-party Python libaries you use the correct package management tools.

There are two routes to installing libraries into the default `python` distribution. Firstly you can use `apt` and install pre-configured system packages, or alternatively you can use `pip` to install packages that are not distributed as part of Raspberry Pi OS.

IMPORTANT: From _Bookworm_ onwards packages installed via `pip` must be installed into a Python Virtual Environment using `venv`. This has been introduced by the Python community not Raspberry Pi, see https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/[PEP 668] for more details

=== Installing Python packages using apt

IMPORTANT: Installing packages using `apt` is the preferred method for installing Python libraries on Raspberry Pi OS. 

Packages installed via `apt` are tested, usually pre-compiled so they install faster, and are designed for Raspberry Pi OS. They won't break your system. Additionally installing via this route means that all required dependencies are also installed, and a log of installation is maintained by the OS so installation can be easily rolled back (uninstalled) if needed.

For instance to install the Python 3 library to support our xref:../accessories/build-hat.adoc[Build HAT] you would;

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo apt install python3-build-hat
----

to install the pre-built library. 

Using `apt` makes installing larger packages, like `numpy` which has many native dependencies including a Fortran compiler, much simpler than installing individual packages using Python's own package management system.

If you want to install a Python library called "foobar" you can use `apt search foobar` to search for the exact package name. In most cases you'll find that the required package is going to be called `python-foobar` or `python3-foobar`.

=== About Python virtual enivronments

In previous versions of the operating system you used to be able to directly install libraries system wide using the package installer for Python, commonly known as `pip`. You'll find the following sort of command in many tutorials online.

[source,bash]
----
$ pip install buildhat
----

However, in newer versions of Raspberry Pi OS, and other operating systems, this is disallowed. If you try and install a Python package system wide you'll recieve an error similar to this,

[source,bash]
----
$ pip install buildhat
error: externally-managed-environment

× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
  python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
  install.

  If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,
  create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.
  Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make
  sure you have python3-full installed.

  For more information visit http://rptl.io/venv

note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.
hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.

This error is generated because you're trying to install a third-party package into the system Python. A long-standing practical problem for Python users has been conflicts between OS package managers like `apt` and Python-specific package management tools like `pip`. These conflicts include both Python-level API incompatibilities and conflicts over file ownership.

Therefore from _Bookworm_ onwards packages installed via `pip` must be installed into a Python Virtual Environment using `venv`. A virtual environment is a container where you can safely install third-party modules so they won't interfere with, or break, your system Python.

=== Using pip with virtual environments

To use a virtual environment the first thing you need to do is to create a container to store the environment. There are several ways you can do this depending on how you want to work with Python.

==== Using a separate environment for each project

One way you can proceed is to create a new virtual environment for each Python project you make, here you'll create a directory to hold your own code along with a virtual environment directory, 

[source,bash]
----
$ mkdir my_project
$ cd my_project
$ python -m venv env
----

if you now look inside the `my_project` directory you'll see a directory called `env`.

[source,bash]
----
$ ls -la
total 12
drwxr-xr-x  3 pi pi 4096 Oct  3 14:34 .
drwx------ 20 pi pi 4096 Oct  3 14:34 ..
drwxr-xr-x  5 pi pi 4096 Oct  3 14:34 env
$
----

NOTE: If you want to inherit the currently installed packages from the system Python you should create your virtual environment using `python -m venv --system-site-packages env`.

Inside this directory is full Python distribution. To activate your virtual environment and make that version of Python the one you're currently using you should type,

[source,bash]
----
$ source env/bin/activate
(env) $
----

and you'll see that your prompt is now prepended with `(env)` to indicate that you're no longer using the system Python. Instead you're using the version of Python contained inside your virtual environment. Any changes you make here, or modules you install into your environment, won't cause problems for your system Python.

[source,bash]
----
(env) $ which python
/home/pi/my_project/env/bin/python
----

If we go ahead and install a third-party package it'll install into the Python distribution in our virtual environment,

[source,bash]
----
(env) $ pip install buildhat

and if you `pip list` you'll see that your current version of Python has your new modules 

[source,bash]
----
(env) $ pip list
Package    Version

buildhat   0.5.12
colorzero  2.0
gpiozero   2.0
pip        23.0.1
pyserial   3.5
setuptools 66.1.1
----

After writing your code, you can run it from the command line inside the virtual environment as you'd expect by invoking Python as normal.

[source,bash]
----
(env) $ ls -la
total 12
drwxr-xr-x  3 pi pi 4096 Oct  3 14:34 .
drwx------ 20 pi pi 4096 Oct  3 14:34 ..
drwxr-xr-x  5 pi pi 4096 Oct  3 14:34 env
-rw-r--r--  1 pi pi    0 Oct  3 14:45 my_code.py
(env) $ python my_code.py
Hello World!
(env) $
----

You can leave your virtual environment and return to using the system Python by typing,

[source,bash]
----
(env) $ deactivate
$
----

and prove to yourself you've done so by checking the installed packages using `pip list`. You'll see there is a considerable difference!

==== Using a separate environment for each user

An alternative method to creating a virtual environment for each of your Python projects is to create a single virtual environment for your user account and then activate that environment before running any of your Python code. This approach may be preferred if you commonly install the same set of modules for each project, and don't want to have to bother creating individual Python environments for each project essentially just duplicating your environment.

[source,bash]
----
$ python -m venv ~/.env
$ source ~/.env/bin/activate
(.env) $
----

We can again check we're in a separate environment by using `pip list`,

[source,bash]
----
(.env) $ pip list
Package    Version
---------- -------
pip        23.0.1
setuptools 66.1.1
----

and leave it using `deactivate`.

[source,bash]
----
(.env) $ deactivate
$
----
