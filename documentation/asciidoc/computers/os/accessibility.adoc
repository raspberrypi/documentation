=== Visual aids

Visually-impaired users of Raspberry Pi OS can find helpful tools in the Recommend Software menu.

We offer the https://help.gnome.org/users/orca/stable/introduction.html.en[Orca screen reader] to better navigate your way through the Raspberry Pi operating system, along with a screen magnifier to increase the readability of UI and screen elements.

==== Orca screen reader

You can install Orca screen reader from the *Recommended Software* section of the main Raspberry Pi menu. Alternatively you can press *Ctrl* + *Alt* + *Space* to automatically install Orca.

When booting Raspberry Pi OS for the first time after installing a new image, an automatic spoken reminder will play after 30 seconds. This reminder will provide instructions on how to install Orca.
