== Playing Audio and Video

The simplest way of playing audio and video on Raspberry Pi is to use the pre-installed VLC application. This is hardware accelerated, and can play back many popular audio and video file formats. More extensive information can be found at https://www.videolan.org/

=== The VLC application

To play an audio or video file in the Raspberry Pi OS desktop environment, you can simply double-click on the file in the file-manager, and VLC will automatically launch and play the file. Alternatively, you can launch "VLC Media Player" from the "Sound & Video" menu, and then select "Media" -> "Open File..." and navigate to the file you want to play. By default the audio is sent over the HDMI link; if you instead want to output the audio over the Headphone jack, right-click on the speaker-icon in the top-right corner of the screen, and select "AV Jack".

For more fine-grained control, you can also launch VLC from the command-line. For the examples below, we used a short clip from Big Buck Bunny.

----
wget --trust-server-names http://rptl.io/big-buck-bunny
vlc big-buck-bunny-1080p.mp4
----

To prevent the VLC GUI staying open after your file has finished playing, you can add the `--play-and-exit` flag:

----
vlc --play-and-exit big-buck-bunny-1080p.mp4
----

You can also add the `--fullscreen` flag to force a video to use the full screen - and this can also lead to smoother playback in some circumstances.

----
vlc --play-and-exit --fullscreen big-buck-bunny-1080p.mp4
----

If you use `cvlc` instead of `vlc` with any of these commands, then the VLC GUI won't be shown:

----
cvlc --play-and-exit big-buck-bunny-1080p.mp4
----

If you have a raw H264 stream, for example as captured from the Raspberry Pi Camera Module, you will get much smoother playback in VLC by encapsulating the stream inside a container-format. This can be done using `ffmpeg`, for example this command converts `video.h264` to a containerised `video.mp4` at 30 fps:

`ffmpeg -r 30 -i video.h264 -c:v copy video.mp4`

=== Playing Audio and Video on Raspberry Pi OS Lite

Firstly, install the necessary VLC components:

----
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends vlc-bin vlc-plugin-base
----

And then download and play an example audio file:

----
wget --trust-server-names http://rptl.io/startup-music
cvlc --play-and-exit computer-startup-music.mp3
----

To force the audio output to a particular device, you need to use:

----
cvlc --play-and-exit -A alsa --alsa-audio-device <alsa-device> computer-startup-music.mp3
----

replacing `<alsa-device>` with one of the following options:

|===
| ALSA device | Description

| sysdefault:CARD=Headphones | The headphone jack

| sysdefault:CARD=vc4hdmi | The HDMI output on a Raspberry Pi Zero, or Raspberry Pi Model 1, 2 or 3

| sysdefault:CARD=vc4hdmi0 | The HDMI0 output on a Raspberry Pi 4 or 400

| sysdefault:CARD=vc4hdmi1 | The HDMI1 output on a Raspberry Pi 4 or 400

|===

Use the following command to get a list of all ALSA devices on your Raspberry Pi:

----
aplay -L | grep sysdefault
----

To force the video output to a particular device, you need to use:

----
cvlc --play-and-exit --drm-vout-display <drm-device> big-buck-bunny-1080p.mp4
----

replacing `<drm-device>` with one of the following options:

|===
| DRM device | Description

| HDMI-A-1 | The HDMI output on a Raspberry Pi Zero, or Raspberry Pi Model 1, 2 or 3; *or* the HDMI0 output on a Raspberry Pi 4 or 400

| HDMI-A-2 | The HDMI1 output on a Raspberry Pi 4 or 400

| DSI-1 | The Raspberry Pi Touch Display

|===

Use the following command to get a list of all DRM devices on your Raspberry Pi:

----
kmsprint | grep Connector
----

You can combine these options, so to direct the video output to the touchscreen, and the audio output to the headphone jack, you'd use

----
cvlc --play-and-exit --fullscreen --drm-vout-display DSI-1 -A alsa --alsa-audio-device sysdefault:CARD=Headphones your_video.mp4
----
