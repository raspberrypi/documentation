At Raspberry Pi we're trying to open source as much of our code as possible to make it easy to use and adapt for your own uses. Raspberry Pi develops and supports software specifically for our products and focuses its energy on software which provides the most optimal user experience. For example, drivers which optimize multimedia acceleration such as the 3D, HEVC decode, the camera imaging pipeline, AI acceleration, dual HDMI and audio.

== Finding software sources in Raspberry Pi OS

When looking for software which is distributed with Raspberry Pi OS, there are often upstream software sources that we patch to create our downstream packages (those tagged with `pass:[+rpt]`). To view the source for those packages it is usually easier to fetch through apt. To do this, you first need to edit your apt lists to include the source packages. The following files should be edited to remove the leading `pass:[#]` from each `deb-src` line:

* `+/etc/apt/sources.list+`
* `+/etc/apt/sources.list.d/raspi.list+`

Next you must update the package lists:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt update
----

Now you can fetch the package source, for example:

[source,console]
----
$ apt source labwc
----

Next, you need to install a helper package:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt install devscripts
----

Finally you can build the package using the standard Debian building process.

[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt build-dep labwc
$ cd labwc-0.8.4
$ debuild -uc -us
----

== Our GitHub organizations

The other place you can find our software in a more standard form is in our GitHub repositories, we have three GitHub organisations we use to store our sources:

* https://github.com/raspberrypi
* https://github.com/raspberrypi-ui
* https://github.com/RPi-Distro
