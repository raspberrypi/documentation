== Displays

To configure your Raspberry Pi to use a non-default display mode, set the resolution or rotation manually.

=== Support for HDMI monitors

With most HDMI monitors, Raspberry Pi OS uses the highest resolution and refresh rate supported by the monitor.

The Raspberry Pi Zero, Zero W and Zero 2 W have a mini HDMI port, so you need a mini-HDMI-to-full-size-HDMI lead or adapter.

Flagship models since Raspberry Pi 4B and Keyboard models have two micro HDMI ports, so you need a micro-HDMI-to-full-size-HDMI lead or adapter for each display you wish to attach. Connect the cables before turning on the Raspberry Pi.

Flagship models since Raspberry Pi 4B, Compute Modules since CM4 (except for CM4S), and Keyboard models can drive up to two displays.

4-series devices support resolutions up to 1080p at a 60Hz refresh rate, or two 4K displays at a 30Hz refresh rate. You can also drive a single display at 4K with a 60Hz refresh rate if you connect the display to the `HDMI0` port and set the `hdmi_enable_4kp60=1` flag in xref:../computers/config_txt.adoc#what-is-config-txt[`/boot/firmware/config.txt`].

5-series devices support up to two displays at 4K resolution at a 60hz refresh rate with no additional configuration.

=== Set resolution and rotation

In Raspberry Pi OS Trixie, display resolution and screen rotation are managed using the 'Control Centre' application.  
This replaces older tools such as 'Screen Configuration', 'raindrop', and 'arandr', which were used in previous Raspberry Pi OS releases.

If you are following older guides or tutorials, note that those tools are no longer present or required.

=== Change resolution and rotation using the graphical interface (recommended)

This is the easiest and recommended method for most users.

STEPS

1. Start your Raspberry Pi and log in to the desktop.
2. Look at the **top-right corner of the screen** to find the system tray.
3. Click on the 'Control Centre' icon.
4. Open the 'Display' (or 'Displays') section.
5. Select the display you want to configure.
6. Choose:
   - the desired **screen resolution**
   - the desired **screen orientation** (normal, left, right, inverted)
7. Apply the changes to update your display settings.

The screen should update immediately after applying the changes.

=== Identify connected display devices using the terminal (advanced)

In some cases, you may want to check which display connectors are detected by the system.  
This is mainly useful for troubleshooting or advanced configuration.

To list connected display devices, open a terminal and run:

[source,console]
----
$ kmsprint | grep Connector
----

What this command does

- kmsprint shows display information
- grep Connector filters the output to show only display connectors

This helps identify connected monitors for troubleshooting purposes.

=== Notes about older screen configuration tools

Earlier versions of Raspberry Pi OS used different utilities for display configuration, such as:

- Screen Configuration

- raindrop

- arandr

These tools are no longer used in Raspberry Pi OS Trixie.
You do not need to install or remove them, and any documentation that refers to these tools should be considered outdated.

For current systems, always use the Control Centre for display configuration.


[TIP]
====
If you have already installed `raindrop`, you can uninstall it with the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt remove --purge raindrop -y
----

To uninstall `arandr`, run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt purge arandr
----
====

=== Summary

- Use Control Centre to change resolution and rotation

- Use the terminal only for checking display information

- Ignore old tutorials that mention raindrop or arandr

- Raspberry Pi OS Trixie uses a new display configuration system
