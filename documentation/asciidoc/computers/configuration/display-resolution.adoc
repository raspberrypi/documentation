== Displays

To configure your Raspberry Pi to use a non-default display mode, set the resolution or rotation manually.

=== Support for HDMI monitors

With most HDMI monitors, Raspberry Pi OS uses the highest resolution and refresh rate supported by the monitor.

The Raspberry Pi Zero, Zero W and Zero 2 W have a mini HDMI port, so you need a mini-HDMI-to-full-size-HDMI lead or adapter.

Flagship models since Raspberry Pi 4B and Keyboard models have two micro HDMI ports, so you need a micro-HDMI-to-full-size-HDMI lead or adapter for each display you wish to attach. Connect the cables before turning on the Raspberry Pi.

Flagship models since Raspberry Pi 4B, Compute Modules since CM4 (except for CM4S), and Keyboard models can drive up to two displays.

4-series devices support resolutions up to 1080p at a 60Hz refresh rate, or two 4K displays at a 30Hz refresh rate. You can also drive a single display at 4K with a 60Hz refresh rate if you connect the display to the `HDMI0` port and set the `hdmi_enable_4kp60=1` flag in xref:../computers/config_txt.adoc#what-is-config-txt[`/boot/firmware/config.txt`].

5-series devices support up to two displays at 4K resolution at a 60hz refresh rate with no additional configuration.

=== Set resolution and rotation

On the Raspberry Pi Desktop, open the *Preferences* menu and select the **Screen Configuration** utility. You should see a graphical representation of the displays connected to the Raspberry Pi. Right click on the display you wish to modify, and select an option. Click **Apply** to and close **Screen Configuration** to save your changes.

Alternatively, use the following command to open the **Screen Configuration** utility:

[source,console]
----
$ raindrop
----

[TIP]
====
If your installation of Raspberry Pi OS doesn't already include `raindrop`, you can install it with the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt install raindrop
----

Older versions of Raspberry Pi OS used a different screen configuration utility named `arandr`. To uninstall `arandr`, run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt purge arandr
----
====

=== Manually set resolution and rotation

==== Determine display device name

To manually configure resolution and rotation, you'll need to know the names of your display devices. To determine the device names, run the following command to display information about attached devices:

[source,console]
----
$ kmsprint | grep Connector
----

==== Set a custom resolution

To set a custom resolution, use our Screen Configuration tool, `raindrop`. If your Raspberry Pi OS installation doesn't already include `raindrop` (for instance, if you're still using the previous Screen Configuration tool, `arandr`), you can download `raindrop` from `apt` or the Recommended Software GUI.

==== Set a custom rotation

To set a custom resolution, use our Screen Configuration tool, `raindrop`. If your Raspberry Pi OS installation doesn't already include `raindrop` (for instance, if you're still using the previous Screen Configuration tool, `arandr`), you can download `raindrop` from `apt` or the Recommended Software GUI.

If you run the Wayland desktop compositor, you can set a custom display rotation with `wlr-randr`. The following commands rotate the display by 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°:

[source,console]
----
$ wlr-randr --output HDMI-A-1 --transform normal
$ wlr-randr --output HDMI-A-1 --transform 90
$ wlr-randr --output HDMI-A-1 --transform 180
$ wlr-randr --output HDMI-A-1 --transform 270
----

The `--output` option specifies the device to be rotated.

NOTE: To run this command over SSH, add the following prefix: `WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1`, e.g. `WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1 wlr-randr --output HDMI-A-1 --transform 90`.

You can also use one of the following `--transform` options to mirror the display at the same time as rotating it: `flipped`, `flipped-90`, `flipped-180`, `flipped-270`.

=== Console resolution and rotation

To change the resolution and rotation of your Raspberry Pi in console mode, use the KMS settings. For more information, see <<kernel-command-line-cmdline-txt,configuring the kernel command line>>.

NOTE: When using console mode with multiple displays, all connected displays share the same rotation settings.
