== Displays

To configure your Raspberry Pi to use a non-default display mode, set the resolution or rotation manually.

=== Support for HDMI monitors

With most HDMI monitors, Raspberry Pi OS uses the highest resolution and refresh rate supported by the monitor.

The Raspberry Pi Zero, Zero W and Zero 2 W have a mini HDMI port, so you need a mini-HDMI-to-full-size-HDMI lead or adapter.

Flagship models since Raspberry Pi 4B and Keyboard models have two micro HDMI ports, so you need a micro-HDMI-to-full-size-HDMI lead or adapter for each display you wish to attach. Connect the cables before turning on the Raspberry Pi.

Flagship models since Raspberry Pi 4B, Compute Modules since CM4 (except for CM4S), and Keyboard models can drive up to two displays.

4-series devices support resolutions up to 1080p at a 60Hz refresh rate, or two 4K displays at a 30Hz refresh rate. You can also drive a single display at 4K with a 60Hz refresh rate if you connect the display to the `HDMI0` port and set the `hdmi_enable_4kp60=1` flag in xref:../computers/config_txt.adoc#what-is-config-txt[`/boot/firmware/config.txt`].

5-series devices support up to two displays at 4K resolution at a 60hz refresh rate with no additional configuration.

=== Set resolution and rotation

The updated Raspberry Pi OS allows users to adjust their display resolution and screen orientation directly through the desktop environment using the Screen Configuration utility. This modern approach replaces older tools like ARandR and Raindrop, providing an intuitive interface where users can select the optimal resolution for their monitor, adjust the orientation, and immediately see the effects.

== Using the desktop (Raspberry Pi OS with desktop)

the desktop version of Raspberry Pi OS (formerly called Raspbian), the settings are now handled via the Screen Configuration utility in the Control Centre (or similar menu).

1.	Open the Menu: Click the Raspberry Pi icon (main application menu).
2.	Navigate to Preferences: Go to Preferences.
3.	Open Screen Configuration: Select Screen Configuration (or a similarly named item like Display or Screens).
4.	Configure Display:
 - Resolution: Select your desired display (e.g., HDMI-A-1 ) and choose the new Resolution from the dropdown menu.
 - Rotation/Orientation: You can often right-click the display icon within this utility to select the desired Orientation (e.g., Normal, 90 degrees, 180 degrees).
5.	Apply Changes: Click Apply and then OK to save and activate the new settings.


**IMPORTANT:**
Do *not* use older screen configuration tools such as `raindrop` or `arandr`.
They are no longer used directly and should not be installed, removed, or run manually.

== Using the command line on the desktop (advanced users only)

This method is optional and intended only for advanced users who cannot access the graphical interface.

To rotate a display using the terminal, run **one** of the following commands:

[source,console]
----
$ wlr-randr --output HDMI-A-1 --transform normal
$ wlr-randr --output HDMI-A-1 --transform 90
$ wlr-randr --output HDMI-A-1 --transform 180
$ wlr-randr --output HDMI-A-1 --transform 270
----

Each command rotates the display as follows:

* `normal` – default orientation
* `90` – rotate 90 degrees clockwise
* `180` – rotate upside down
* `270` – rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise

```text
NOTES:
- Run only **one** command at a time.
- Replace `HDMI-A-1` with your actual display name if needed.
```

**IMPORTANT:**
- Do *not* install, remove, or run `raindrop` or `arandr`.
- On Raspberry Pi OS Trixie, required components are handled automatically by the system.

== Console resolution and rotation (Raspberry Pi OS Lite)

This section applies to Raspberry Pi OS Lite or systems without a desktop environment.

Use the terminal only to check display information or when running in console mode.

To change resolution and rotation in console mode, configure Kernel Mode Setting (KMS).
For details, see <<kernel-command-line-cmdline-txt,configuring the kernel command line>>.


**IMPORTANT:**
Ignore any tutorials or guides that mention `raindrop` or `arandr`.
These tools are not used for console-only setups and can cause confusion.

```text
NOTE:
When using console mode with multiple displays, all connected displays share the same rotation settings.
```
