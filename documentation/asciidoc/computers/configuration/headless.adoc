== Set up a headless Raspberry Pi

A **headless** Raspberry Pi runs without a monitor, keyboard, or mouse. To run a Raspberry Pi headless, you need a way to access it from another computer. To access your Raspberry Pi remotely, you'll need to connect your Raspberry Pi to a network, and a way to access the Raspberry Pi over that network.

To connect your Raspberry Pi to a network, you can either plug your device into a wired connection via Ethernet or configure wireless networking.

To access your Raspberry Pi over that network, use SSH. Once you've connected over SSH, you can use `raspi-config` to xref:remote-access.adoc#vnc[enable VNC] if you'd prefer a graphical desktop environment.

If you're setting up your Raspberry Pi from scratch, set up wireless networking and SSH during the xref:getting-started.adoc#installing-the-operating-system[imaging process]. If you've already got a Raspberry Pi set up, you can configure SSH using `raspi-config`.

WARNING: Depending on the model of Raspberry Pi and type of SD card you use, your Raspberry Pi may require up to five minutes to boot and connect to your wireless network the first time it boots.

=== Connect to a wired network

To connect to a wired network at first boot, plug your headless Raspberry Pi in via Ethernet, or use an Ethernet adapter if your Raspberry Pi model does not include an Ethernet port. Your Raspberry Pi will automatically connect to the network.

=== Connect to a wireless network

To configure wireless network access at first boot in a headless Raspberry Pi, use the advanced settings menu in Raspberry Pi Imager. Enter the SSID and password of your preferred wireless network. Your Raspberry Pi will use these credentials to connect to the network on first boot. Some wireless adapters and some Raspberry Pi boards do not support 5GHz networks; check the documentation for your wireless module to ensure compatibility with your preferred network.

NOTE: Previous versions of Raspberry Pi OS made use of a `wpa_supplicant.conf` file which could be placed into the boot folder to configure wireless network settings. This functionality is not available from Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm onwards.

=== Remote access

With no keyboard or monitor, you need a way to xref:remote-access.adoc[remotely control] your headless Raspberry Pi. On first boot, the only option is SSH. To enable SSH on a fresh installation of Raspberry Pi OS, choose one of the following methods:

* enable SSH in the OS customisation menu in Raspberry Pi Imager, then enter a username and password
* create a file named `ssh` at the root of the first partition of the SD card (labeled `bootfs`), then configure a user manually with `userconf.txt` following the instructions in the section below

For more information, see xref:remote-access.adoc#ssh[set up an SSH server]. Once you've connected over SSH, you can use `raspi-config` to xref:remote-access.adoc#vnc[enable VNC] if you'd prefer a graphical desktop environment.

[[configuring-a-user]]
==== Configure a user manually

At the root of the first partion of your SD card (the filesystem labeled `bootfs`), create a file named `userconf.txt`.

This file should contain a single line of text, consisting of `<username>:<password>`: your desired username, followed immediately by a colon, followed immediately by an *encrypted* representation of the password you want to use.

NOTE: `<username>` must only contain lower-case letters, digits and hyphens, and must start with a letter. It may not be longer than 31 characters. 

To generate the encrypted password, use https://www.openssl.org[OpenSSL] on another computer. Open a terminal and enter the following:

[source,console]
----
$ openssl passwd -6
----

When prompted, enter your password and verify it. This command will then output an encrypted version of the supplied password.
