== Setting up a Headless Raspberry Pi

To use your Raspberry Pi without a monitor or keyboard (known as headless), you need to enable wireless networking and SSH.

If you haven't already imaged your Raspberry Pi, you can set up wireless networking and SSH during the xref:getting-started.adoc#installing-the-operating-system[imaging process].

If you already have an image on the micro SD card, you can access the xref:configuration.adoc#the-boot-folder[boot folder] by inserting the card into a card reader on a Linux or Windows machine. Adding certain files to this folder will activate certain setup features on the first boot of the Raspberry Pi.

IMPORTANT: If you are installing Raspberry Pi OS, and intend to run it headless, you will need to create a new user account. Since you will not be able to create the user account xref:getting-started.adoc#initial-setup-and-configuration[using the first-boot wizard] as it requires both a monitor and a keyboard, you *MUST* add a `userconf.txt` file to the boot folder to create a user on first boot or configure the OS with a user account using the xref:getting-started.adoc#advanced-options[Advanced Menu] in the Raspberry Pi Imager.

=== Configuring Networking

You will need to define a `wpa_supplicant.conf` file for your particular wireless network. Put this file onto the boot folder of the SD card. When the Raspberry Pi boots for the first time, it will copy that file into the correct location in the Linux root file system and use those settings to start up wireless networking.

The Raspberry Pi's IP address will not be visible immediately after power on, so this step is crucial to connect to it headlessly. Depending on the OS and editor you are creating this on, the file could have incorrect newlines or the wrong file extension so make sure you use an editor that accounts for this. Linux expects the line feed (LF) newline character. 

WARNING: After your Raspberry Pi is connected to power, make sure to wait a few (up to 5) minutes for it to boot up and register on the network.

A xref:configuration.adoc#wireless-networking-command-line[`wpa_supplicant.conf`] file example:

----
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
country=<Insert 2 letter ISO 3166-1 country code here>
update_config=1

network={
 ssid="<Name of your wireless LAN>"
 psk="<Password for your wireless LAN>"
}
----

Where the country code should be set the two letter ISO/IEC alpha2 code for the country in which you are using, e.g.

* GB (United Kingdom)
* FR (France)
* DE (Germany)
* US (United States)
* SE (Sweden)

Here is a more elaborate example that should work for most typical wpa2 personal networks. This template below works for 2.4ghz/5ghz hidden or not networks. The utilization of quotes around the ssid - psk can help avoid any oddities if your network ssid or password has special chars (! @ # $ etc)

----
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=<Insert 2 letter ISO 3166-1 country code here>

network={
        scan_ssid=1
        ssid="<Name of your wireless LAN>"
        psk="<Password for your wireless LAN>"
        proto=RSN
        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
        pairwise=CCMP
        auth_alg=OPEN
}
----

NOTE: Some older Raspberry Pi boards and some USB wireless dongles do not support 5GHz networks.

NOTE: With no keyboard or monitor, you will need some way of xref:remote-access.adoc[remotely accessing] your headless Raspberry Pi. For headless setup, SSH can be enabled by placing a file named `ssh`, without any extension, onto the boot folder of the SD Card. For more information see the section on xref:remote-access.adoc#ssh[setting up an SSH server].

[[configuring-a-user]]
=== Configuring a User

You will need to add a `userconf.txt` in the boot partition of the SD card; this is the part of the SD card which can be seen when it is mounted in a Windows or MacOS computer.

This file should contain a single line of text, consisting of `username:password` – so your desired username, followed immediately by a colon, followed immediately by an *encrypted* representation of the password you want to use.

To generate the encrypted password, the easiest way is to use OpenSSL on a Raspberry Pi that is already running – open a terminal window and enter:

----
openssl passwd -6
----

This will prompt you to enter your password, and verify it. It will then produce what looks like a string of random characters, which is actually an encrypted version of the supplied password.
