== Audio Configuration

The Raspberry Pi has up to three audio output modes: HDMI 1 and 2, if present, and a headphone jack. You can switch between these modes at any time.

NOTE: Audio output over HDMI will provide better sound quality than audio output over the headphone jack.

If your HDMI monitor or TV has built-in speakers, the audio can be played over the HDMI cable, but you can switch it to a set of headphones or other speakers plugged into the headphone jack. If your display claims to have speakers, sound is output via HDMI by default; if not, it is output via the headphone jack. This may not be the desired output setup, or the auto-detection is inaccurate, in which case you can manually switch the output.

=== Changing the Audio Output

There are two ways of setting the audio output; using the desktop volume control, or using the `raspi-config` command line tool.

==== Using the Desktop

Right-clicking the volume icon on the desktop taskbar brings up the audio output selector; this allows you to select between the internal audio outputs. It also allows you to select any external audio devices, such as USB sound cards and Bluetooth audio devices. A tick is shown against the currently selected audio output device -- simply left-click the desired output in the pop-up menu to change this. The volume control and mute operate on the currently selected device.

==== Using raspi-config

Open up xref:configuration.adoc#raspi-config[raspi-config] by entering the following into the command line:

----
sudo raspi-config
----

This will open the configuration screen:

Select `System Options` (currently option 1, but yours may be different) and press `Enter`.

Now select the `Audio` option (currently option S2, but yours may be different) and press `Enter`.

Select your required mode, press `Enter` and press the right arrow key to exit the options list, then select `Finish` to exit the configuration tool.
