== Configuring Screen Blanking

You can configure your Raspberry Pi to use a screen saver or to blank the screen.

=== On Console

When running without a graphical desktop, Raspberry Pi OS will blank the screen after 10 minutes without user input, e.g. mouse movement or key presses.

The current setting, in seconds, can be displayed using:

[,bash]
----
cat /sys/module/kernel/parameters/consoleblank
----

You can use the `raspi-config` tool to disable screen blanking. Note that the screen blanking setting in `raspi-config` also controls screen blanking when the graphical desktop is running.

=== On the Desktop

Raspberry Pi OS will blank the graphical desktop after 10 minutes without user input. You can disable this by changing the 'Screen Blanking' option in the Raspberry Pi Configuration tool, available from the *Preferences* menu. The 'Screen Blanking' option also controls screen blanking when the graphical desktop is not running.
