=== Change a user's password

You can change the password for the current user account via the `raspi-config` application on from the command line:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo raspi-config
----

Select option 2, and follow the instructions to change the password.

Alternatively, use the `passwd` application:

[source,console]
----
$ passwd
----

=== Add a user

To add a new user, enter the following command, replacing the `<username>` placeholder with the username for the new user:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo adduser <username>
----

When prompted, enter a password for the new user.

You can find the home directory for the new user at `/home/<username>/`.

To grant the new user necessary permissions, like `sudo`, run the following command to add the user to the associated user groups, replacing the `<username>` placeholder with the username for the new user:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo usermod -a -G adm,dialout,cdrom,sudo,audio,video,plugdev,games,users,input,render,netdev,lpadmin,gpio,i2c,spi <username>
----

To check that the permissions were successfully granted, run the following command, replacing the `<username>` placeholder with the username for the new user:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo su - <username>
----

If the above command runs successfully, permissions were successfully configured for the user.

=== Delete a user

To delete a user, run the following command, replacing the `<username>` placeholder with the username you would like to delete:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo deluser -remove-home <username>
----

This command deletes the user as well as their home directory. If you'd like to preserve the user's home directory, run the command without the `-remove-home` option.

=== Change the default user

To change the user that automatically logs into your Raspberry Pi on boot, run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo raspi-config
----

Select option `1`, `Boot/Auto login`. Reboot to put your changes into effect.
