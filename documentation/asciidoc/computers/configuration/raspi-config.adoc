[[raspi-config]]
== The `raspi-config` Tool

`raspi-config` is the Raspberry Pi configuration tool originally written by https://github.com/asb[Alex Bradbury]. To open the configuration tool, type the following on the command line:

----
sudo raspi-config
----

The `sudo` is required because you will be changing files that you do not own as your regular user.

NOTE: If you are using the Raspberry Pi desktop then you can use the graphical `Raspberry Pi Configuration` application from the `Preferences` menu to configure your Raspberry Pi.

You should then see a blue screen with options in a grey box:

image::images/raspi-config.png[raspi-config main screen]

NOTE: The menu shown may differ slightly.

Use the `up` and `down` arrow keys to move the highlighted selection between the options available. Pressing the `right` arrow key will jump out of the Options menu and take you to the `<Select>` and `<Finish>` buttons. Pressing `left` will take you back to the options. Alternatively, you can use the `Tab` key to switch between these.

Generally speaking, `raspi-config` aims to provide the functionality to make the most common configuration changes. This may result in automated edits to `/boot/config.txt` and various standard Linux configuration files. Some options require a reboot to take effect. If you changed any of those, `raspi-config` will ask if you wish to reboot now when you select the `<Finish>` button.

NOTE: In long lists of option values (like the list of timezone cities), you can also type a letter to skip to that section of the list. For example, entering `L` will skip you to Lisbon, just two options away from London, to save you scrolling all the way through the alphabet.

[[menu-options]]
=== List of Options

NOTE: Due to the continual development of the `raspi-config` tool, the list of options below may not be completely up to date. Also please be aware that different models of Raspberry Pi may have different options available.

NOTE: All options are available via a non-interactive command line interface. See the section on the <<raspi-config-cli,`raspi-config` command line interface>> for more information.
