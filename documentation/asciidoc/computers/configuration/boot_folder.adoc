== The `boot` Folder

In a basic xref:os.adoc[Raspberry Pi OS] install, the boot files are stored on the first partition of the SD card, which is formatted with the FAT file system. This means that it can be read on Windows, macOS, and Linux devices.

When the Raspberry Pi is powered on, it loads various files from the boot partition/folder in order to start up the various processors, then it boots the Linux kernel.

Once Linux has booted, the boot partition is mounted as `/boot`.

=== Boot Folder Contents

==== bootcode.bin

This is the bootloader, which is loaded by the SoC on boot, does some very basic setup, and then loads one of the `start*.elf` files. `bootcode.bin` is not used on the Raspberry Pi 4, because it has been replaced by boot code in the xref:raspberry-pi.adoc#raspberry-pi-4-boot-eeprom[onboard EEPROM].

==== start.elf, start_x.elf, start_db.elf, start_cd.elf, start4.elf, start4x.elf, start4cd.elf, start4db.elf

These are binary blobs (firmware) that are loaded on to the VideoCore in the SoC, which then take over the boot process.
`start.elf` is the basic firmware, `start_x.elf` includes camera drivers and codec, `start_db.elf` is a debug version of the firmware, and `start_cd.elf` is a cut-down version with no support hardware blocks like codecs and 3D, and for use when `gpu_mem=16` is specified in `config.txt`. More information on how to use these can be found in xref:config_txt.adoc#boot-options[the `config.txt` section].

`start4.elf`, `start4x.elf`, `start4cd.elf`, and `start4db.elf` are firmware files specific to the Pi 4.

==== fixup*.dat

These are linker files and are matched pairs with the `start*.elf` files listed in the previous section.

==== cmdline.txt

The kernel command line passed in to the kernel when it boots.

==== config.txt

Contains many configuration parameters for setting up the Pi. See xref:config_txt.adoc[the `config.txt` section].

==== issue.txt

Some text-based housekeeping information containing the date and git commit ID of the distribution.

==== ssh or ssh.txt

When this file is present, SSH will be enabled on boot. The contents don't matter, it can be empty. SSH is otherwise disabled by default.

==== wpa_supplicant.conf

This is the file to configure wireless network settings (if the hardware is capable of it). Edit the country code and the network part to fit your case. More information on how to use this file can be found in xref:configuration.adoc#setting-up-a-headless-raspberry-pi[the `wireless/headless` section].

==== Device Tree files

There are various Device Tree blob files, which have the extension `.dtb`. These contain the hardware definitions of the various models of Raspberry Pi, and are used on boot to set up the kernel xref:configuration.adoc#part3.1[according to which Pi model is detected].

==== Kernel Files

The boot folder will contain various xref:linux_kernel.adoc#kernel[kernel] image files, used for the different Raspberry Pi models:

|===
| Filename | Processor | Raspberry Pi model | Notes

| kernel.img
| BCM2835
| Pi Zero, Pi 1
|

| kernel7.img
| BCM2836, BCM2837
| Pi 2, Pi 3
| Later Pi 2 uses the BCM2837

| kernel7l.img
| BCM2711
| Pi 4
| Large Physical Address Extension (LPAE)

| kernel8.img
| BCM2837, BCM2711
| Pi 2, Pi 3, Pi 4, Pi 400
| Beta xref:config_txt.adoc#boot-options[64 bit kernel]. Raspberry Pi 2 with BCM2836 does not support 64-bit.
|===

NOTE: The architecture reported by `lscpu` is `armv7l` for systems running a 32-bit kernel (i.e. everything except `kernel8.img`), and `aarch64` for systems running a 64-bit kernel. The `l` in the `armv7l` case refers to the architecture being little-endian, not `LPAE` as is indicated by the `l` in the `kernel7l.img` filename.

=== The Overlays Folder

The `overlays` sub-folder contains Device Tree overlays. These are used to configure various hardware devices that may be attached to the system, for example the Raspberry Pi Touch Display or third-party sound boards. These overlays are selected using entries in `config.txt` -- see xref:configuration.adoc#part2['Device Trees, overlays and parameters, part 2' for more info].
