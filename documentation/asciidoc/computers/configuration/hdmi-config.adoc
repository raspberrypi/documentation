== HDMI Configuration

In the vast majority of cases, simply plugging your HDMI-equipped monitor into the Raspberry Pi using a standard HDMI cable will automatically result in the Raspberry Pi using the best resolution the monitor supports. The Raspberry Pi Zero, Zero W and Zero 2 W use a mini HDMI port, so you will need a mini-HDMI-to-full-size-HDMI lead or adapter. On the Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry Pi 400 there are two micro HDMI ports, so you will need a micro-HDMI-to-full-size-HDMI lead or adapter for each display you wish to attach. You should connect any HDMI leads before turning on the Raspberry Pi.

The Raspberry Pi 4 (and Pi 400) can drive up to two displays, with a resolution up to 1080p at a 60Hz refresh rate. At 4K resolution, if you connect two displays then you are limited to a 30Hz refresh rate. You can also drive a single display at 4K with a 60Hz refresh rate: this requires that the display is attached to the HDMI port adjacent to the USB-C power input (labelled HDMI0). You must also enable 4Kp60 output by setting the `hdmi_enable_4kp60=1` flag in `config.txt`.

The Screen Configuration tool (`arandr`) is a graphical tool for selecting display modes and setting up multiple displays. You can find this tool in the desktop Preferences menu. Use the Layout menu option to select the screen, resolution, and orientation. If you're using a multi-screen setup, drag around the displays to any position you want. When you have the required setup, click the Apply button to apply the settings.
