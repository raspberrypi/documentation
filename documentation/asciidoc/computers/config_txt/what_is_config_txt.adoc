== What is `config.txt`?

The Raspberry Pi uses a configuration file instead of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS[BIOS] you would expect to find on a conventional PC. The system configuration parameters, which would traditionally be edited and stored using a BIOS, are stored instead in a text file named `config.txt`. This is read by the GPU before the ARM CPU and Linux are initialised. It must therefore be located on the first (boot) partition of your SD card, alongside `bootcode.bin` and `start.elf`. This file is normally accessible as `/boot/config.txt` from Linux, and must be edited as the `root` user. From Windows or OS X it is visible as a file in the only accessible part of the card. If you need to apply some of the config settings below, but you don't have a `config.txt` on your boot partition yet, simply create it as a new text file.

Any changes will only take effect after you have rebooted your Raspberry Pi. After Linux has booted, you can view the current active settings using the following commands:

* `vcgencmd get_config <config>`: this displays a specific config value, e.g. `vcgencmd get_config arm_freq`.
* `vcgencmd get_config int`: this lists all the integer config options that are set (non-zero).
* `vcgencmd get_config str`: this lists all the string config options that are set (non-null).

NOTE: There are some config settings that cannot be retrieved using `vcgencmd`.

=== File Format

The `config.txt` file is read by the early-stage boot firmware, so it has a very simple file format. The format is a single `property=value` statement on each line, where `value` is either an integer or a string. Comments may be added, or existing config values may be commented out and disabled, by starting a line with the `#` character.

There is a 98-character line length limit for entries - any characters past this limit will be ignored.

Here is an example file:

----
# Enable audio (loads snd_bcm2835)
dtparam=audio=on

# Automatically load overlays for detected cameras
camera_auto_detect=1

# Automatically load overlays for detected DSI displays
display_auto_detect=1

# Enable DRM VC4 V3D driver
dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d
----

=== Advanced Features

==== `include`

Causes the content of the specified file to be inserted into the current file.

For example, adding the line `include extraconfig.txt` to `config.txt` will include the content of `extraconfig.txt` file in the `config.txt` file.

[NOTE]
====

*Include directives are not supported by the bootcode.bin or EEPROM bootloaders*.

Settings which are handled by the bootloader and so which will only take effect if they are specified in `config.txt` (rather than any additional included file) are:

* `bootcode_delay`,
* `gpu_mem`, `gpu_mem_256`, `gpu_mem_512`, `gpu_mem_1024`,
* `total_mem`,
* `sdram_freq`,
* `start_x`, `start_debug`, `start_file`, `fixup_file`,
* `uart_2ndstage`.

==== Conditional Filtering

Conditional filters are covered in the xref:config_txt.adoc#conditional-filters[conditionals section].
