== What is `config.txt`?

Instead of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS[BIOS] found on a conventional PC, Raspberry Pi devices use a configuration file called `config.txt`. The GPU reads `config.txt` before the Arm CPU and Linux initialise. Raspberry Pi OS looks for this file in the *boot partition*, located at `/boot/firmware/`.

NOTE: Prior to Raspberry Pi OS _Bookworm_, Raspberry Pi OS stored the boot partition at `/boot/`.

You can edit `config.txt` directly from your Raspberry Pi OS installation. You can also remove the storage device and edit files in the boot partition, including `config.txt`, from a separate computer.

Changes to `config.txt` only take effect after a reboot. You can view the current active settings using the following commands:

`vcgencmd get_config <config>`:: displays a specific config value, e.g. `vcgencmd get_config arm_freq`
`vcgencmd get_config int`:: lists all non-zero integer config options (non-zero)
`vcgencmd get_config str`:: lists all non-null string config options

NOTE: Not all config settings can be retrieved using `vcgencmd`.

Some legacy `config.txt` options are no longer officially supported. These are listed in xref:../computers/legacy_config_txt.adoc[Legacy config.txt options] and aren't included in this article.

=== File format

The `config.txt` file is read by the early-stage boot firmware, so it uses a very simple file format: **a single `property=value` statement on each line, where `value` is either an integer or a string**. Comments may be added, or existing config values may be commented out and disabled, by starting a line with the `#` character.

There is a 98-character line length limit for entries. Raspberry Pi OS ignores any characters past this limit.

Here is an example file:

[source,ini]
----
# Enable audio (loads snd_bcm2835)
dtparam=audio=on

# Automatically load overlays for detected cameras
camera_auto_detect=1

# Automatically load overlays for detected DSI displays
display_auto_detect=1

# Enable DRM VC4 V3D driver
dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d
----

=== Advanced features

==== `include`

Causes the content of the specified file to be inserted into the current file.

For example, adding the line `include extraconfig.txt` to `config.txt` will include the content of `extraconfig.txt` file in the `config.txt` file.

[NOTE]
====

The `bootcode.bin` or EEPROM bootloaders do not support the `include` directive.

Settings which are handled by the bootloader will only take effect if they are specified in `config.txt` (rather than any additional included file):

* `bootcode_delay`,
* `gpu_mem`, `gpu_mem_256`, `gpu_mem_512`, `gpu_mem_1024`,
* `total_mem`,
* `sdram_freq`,
* `start_x`, `start_debug`, `start_file`, `fixup_file`,
* `uart_2ndstage`.

==== Conditional filtering

Conditional filters are covered in the xref:config_txt.adoc#conditional-filters[conditionals section].
