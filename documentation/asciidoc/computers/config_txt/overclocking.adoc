== Overclocking Options

The kernel has a https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/pm/cpufreq.html[CPUFreq] driver with the "powersave" governor enabled by default, switched to "ondemand" during boot, when xref:configuration.adoc#raspi-config[raspi-config] is installed. With "ondemand" governor, CPU frequency will vary with processor load. You can adjust the minimum values with the `*_min` config options or disable dynamic clocking by applying a static scaling governor ("powersave" or "performance") or with `force_turbo=1`.

Overclocking and overvoltage will be disabled at runtime when the SoC reaches `temp_limit` (see below), which defaults to 85°C, in order to cool down the SoC. You should not hit this limit with Raspberry Pi 1 and Raspberry Pi 2, but you are more likely to with Raspberry Pi 3 and Raspberry Pi 4. Overclocking and overvoltage are also disabled when an undervoltage situation is detected.

NOTE: For more information xref:raspberry-pi.adoc#frequency-management-and-thermal-control[see the section on frequency management and thermal control].

WARNING: Setting any overclocking parameters to values other than those used by xref:configuration.adoc#overclock[raspi-config] may set a permanent bit within the SoC, making it possible to detect that your Raspberry Pi has been overclocked. The specific circumstances where the overclock bit is set are if `force_turbo` is set to `1` and any of the `over_voltage_*` options are set to a value > `0`. See the https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/introducing-turbo-mode-up-to-50-more-performance-for-free/[blog post on Turbo Mode] for more information.

=== Overclocking

|===
| Option | Description

| arm_freq
| Frequency of the ARM CPU in MHz.

| arm_boost
| Increases `arm_freq` to the highest supported frequency for the board-type and firmware. Set to `1` to enable.

| gpu_freq
| Sets `core_freq`, `h264_freq`, `isp_freq`, `v3d_freq` and `hevc_freq` together

| core_freq
| Frequency of the GPU processor core in MHz, influences CPU performance because it drives the L2 cache and memory bus; the L2 cache benefits only Raspberry Pi Zero / Raspberry Pi Zero W / Raspberry Pi 1, there is a small benefit for SDRAM on Raspberry Pi 2 / Raspberry Pi 3. See section below for use on the Raspberry Pi 4.

| h264_freq
| Frequency of the hardware video block in MHz; individual override of the `gpu_freq` setting

| isp_freq
| Frequency of the image sensor pipeline block in MHz; individual override of the `gpu_freq` setting

| v3d_freq
| Frequency of the 3D block in MHz; individual override of the `gpu_freq` setting

| hevc_freq
| Frequency of the High Efficiency Video Codec block in MHz; individual override of the `gpu_freq` setting. Raspberry Pi 4 only.

| sdram_freq
| Frequency of the SDRAM in MHz. SDRAM overclocking on Raspberry Pi 4B is not currently supported

| over_voltage
| CPU/GPU core upper voltage limit. The value should be in the range [-16,8] which equates to the range [0.95V,1.55V] ([0.8,1.4V] on Raspberry Pi 1) with 0.025V steps. In other words, specifying -16 will give 0.95V (0.8V on Raspberry Pi 1) as the maximum CPU/GPU core voltage, and specifying 8 will allow up to 1.55V (1.4V on Raspberry Pi 1). For defaults see table below. Values above 6 are only allowed when `force_turbo=1` is specified: this sets the warranty bit if `over_voltage_*` > `0` is also set.

| over_voltage_sdram
| Sets `over_voltage_sdram_c`, `over_voltage_sdram_i`, and `over_voltage_sdram_p` together.

| over_voltage_sdram_c
| SDRAM controller voltage adjustment. [-16,8] equates to [0.8V,1.4V] with 0.025V steps.

| over_voltage_sdram_i
| SDRAM I/O voltage adjustment. [-16,8] equates to [0.8V,1.4V] with 0.025V steps.

| over_voltage_sdram_p
| SDRAM phy voltage adjustment. [-16,8] equates to [0.8V,1.4V] with 0.025V steps.

| force_turbo
| Forces turbo mode frequencies even when the ARM cores are not busy. Enabling this may set the warranty bit if `over_voltage_*` is also set.

| initial_turbo
| Enables https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=6201&start=425#p180099[turbo mode from boot] for the given value in seconds, or until cpufreq sets a frequency. The maximum value is `60`.

| arm_freq_min
| Minimum value of `arm_freq` used for dynamic frequency clocking. Note that reducing this value below the default does not result in any significant power savings and is not currently supported.

| core_freq_min
| Minimum value of `core_freq` used for dynamic frequency clocking.

| gpu_freq_min
| Minimum value of `gpu_freq` used for dynamic frequency clocking.

| h264_freq_min
| Minimum value of `h264_freq` used for dynamic frequency clocking.

| isp_freq_min
| Minimum value of `isp_freq` used for dynamic frequency clocking.

| v3d_freq_min
| Minimum value of `v3d_freq` used for dynamic frequency clocking.

| hevc_freq_min
| Minimum value of `hevc_freq` used for dynamic frequency clocking.

| sdram_freq_min
| Minimum value of `sdram_freq` used for dynamic frequency clocking.

| over_voltage_min
| Minimum value of `over_voltage` used for dynamic frequency clocking. The value should be in the range [-16,8] which equates to the range [0.8V,1.4V] with 0.025V steps. In other words, specifying -16 will give 0.8V as the CPU/GPU core idle voltage, and specifying 8 will give a minimum of 1.4V.

| temp_limit
| Overheat protection. This sets the clocks and voltages to default when the SoC reaches this value in degree Celsius. Values over 85 are clamped to 85.

| temp_soft_limit
| *3A+/3B+ only*. CPU speed throttle control. This sets the temperature at which the CPU clock speed throttling system activates. At this temperature, the clock speed is reduced from 1400MHz to 1200MHz.  Defaults to `60`, can be raised to a maximum of `70`, but this may cause instability.

The firmware uses Adaptive Voltage Scaling (AVS) to determine the optimum CPU/GPU core voltage in the range defined by `over_voltage` and `over_voltage_min`.

===== Specific to Raspberry Pi 4, Raspberry Pi 400 and CM4

The minimum core frequency when the system is idle must be fast enough to support the highest pixel clock (ignoring blanking) of the display(s). Consequently, `core_freq` will be boosted above 500 MHz if the display mode is 4Kp60.

* Overclocking requires the latest firmware release.
* The latest firmware automatically scales up the voltage if the system is overclocked. Manually setting `over_voltage` disables automatic voltage scaling for overclocking.
* It is recommended when overclocking to use the individual frequency settings (`isp_freq`, `v3d_freq` etc) rather than `gpu_freq` because the maximum stable frequency will be different for ISP, V3D, HEVC etc.
* The SDRAM frequency is not configurable on Raspberry Pi 4.

==== `force_turbo`

By default (`force_turbo=0`) the "On Demand" CPU frequency driver will raise clocks to their maximum frequencies when the ARM cores are busy and will lower them to the minimum frequencies when the ARM cores are idle.

`force_turbo=1` overrides this behaviour and forces maximum frequencies even when the ARM cores are not busy.

=== Clocks Relationship

The GPU core, CPU, SDRAM and GPU each have their own PLLs and https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=6201&start=275#p168042[can have unrelated frequencies]. The h264, v3d and ISP blocks share a PLL.

To view the Raspberry Pi's current frequency in KHz, type: `cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq`. Divide the result by 1000 to find the value in MHz. Note that this frequency is the kernel _requested_ frequency, and it is possible that any throttling (for example at high temperatures) may mean the CPU is actually running more slowly than reported. An instantaneous measurement of the actual ARM CPU frequency can be retrieved using the vcgencmd `vcgencmd measure_clock arm`. This is displayed in Hertz.

=== Monitoring Core Temperature

To view the Raspberry Pi's temperature, type `cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp`. Divide the result by 1000 to find the value in degrees Celsius. Alternatively, there is a vcgencmd, `vcgencmd measure_temp` that interrogates the GPU directly for its temperature.

Whilst hitting the temperature limit is not harmful to the SoC, it will cause CPU throttling. A heatsink can help to control the core temperature and therefore performance. This is especially useful if the Raspberry Pi is running inside a case. Airflow over the heatsink will make cooling more efficient.

When the core temperature is between 80'C and 85'C, the ARM cores will be throttled back. If the temperature exceeds 85'C, the ARM cores and the GPU will be throttled back.

For the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, the PCB technology has been changed to provide better heat dissipation and increased thermal mass. In addition, a soft temperature limit has been introduced, with the goal of maximising the time for which a device can "sprint" before reaching the hard limit at 85°C. When the soft limit is reached, the clock speed is reduced from 1.4GHz to 1.2GHz, and the operating voltage is reduced slightly. This reduces the rate of temperature increase: we trade a short period at 1.4GHz for a longer period at 1.2GHz. By default, the soft limit is 60°C, and this can be changed via the `temp_soft_limit` setting in config.txt.

=== Monitoring Voltage

It is essential to keep the supply voltage above 4.8V for reliable performance. Note that the voltage from some USB chargers/power supplies can fall as low as 4.2V. This is because they are usually designed to charge a 3.7V LiPo battery, not to supply 5V to a computer.

To monitor the Raspberry Pi's PSU voltage, you will need to use a multimeter to measure between the VCC and GND pins on the GPIO. More information is available in xref:raspberry-pi.adoc#power-supply[power].

If the voltage drops below 4.63V (+-5%), the ARM cores and the GPU will be throttled back, and a message indicating the low voltage state will be added to the kernel log.

=== Overclocking Problems

Most overclocking issues show up immediately with a failure to boot. If this occurs, hold down the `shift` key during the next boot. This will temporarily disable all overclocking, allowing you to boot successfully and then edit your settings.
