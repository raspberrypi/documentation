== Memory options

=== `total_mem`

This parameter can be used to force a Raspberry Pi to limit its memory capacity: specify the total amount of RAM, in megabytes, you wish the Raspberry Pi to use. For example, to make a 4 GB Raspberry Pi 4B behave as though it were a 1 GB model, use the following:

[source,ini]
----
total_mem=1024
----

This value will be clamped between a minimum of 128 MB, and a maximum of the total memory installed on the board.
