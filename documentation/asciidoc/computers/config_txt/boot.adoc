== Boot Options

=== `start_file`, `fixup_file`

These options specify the firmware files transferred to the VideoCore GPU prior to booting.

`start_file` specifies the VideoCore firmware file to use.
`fixup_file` specifies the file used to fix up memory locations used in the `start_file` to match the GPU memory split. Note that the `start_file` and the `fixup_file` are a matched pair - using unmatched files will stop the board from booting. This is an advanced option, so we advise that you use `start_x` and `start_debug` rather than this option.

NOTE: Cut-down firmware (`start*cd.elf` and `fixup*cd.dat`) cannot be selected this way - the system will fail to boot.  The only way to enable the cut-down firmware is to specify `gpu_mem=16`. The cut-down firmware removes support for codecs and 3D as well as limiting the initial early-boot framebuffer to 1080p @  16bpp - although KMS can replace this with up-to 32bpp 4K framebuffer(s) at a later stage as with any firmware.

=== `cmdline`

`cmdline` is the alternative filename on the boot partition from which to read the kernel command line string; the default value is `cmdline.txt`.

=== `kernel`

`kernel` is the alternative filename on the boot partition to use when loading the kernel. The default value on the Raspberry Pi 1, Zero and Zero W, and Raspberry Pi Compute Module 1 is `kernel.img`. The default value on the Raspberry Pi 2, 3, 3+ and Zero 2 W, and Raspberry Pi Compute Modules 3 and 3+ is `kernel7.img`. The default value on the Raspberry Pi 4 and 400, and Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 is `kernel8.img`, or `kernel7l.img` if `arm_64bit` is set to 0.

=== `arm_64bit`

If set to 1, the kernel will be started in 64-bit mode. Setting to 0 selects 32-bit mode.

In 64-bit mode, the firmware will choose an appropriate kernel (e.g. `kernel8.img`), unless there is an explicit `kernel` option defined, in which case that is used instead.

Defaults to 1 on Pi 4s (Pi 4B, Pi 400, CM4 and CM4S), and 0 on all other platforms. However, if the name given in an explicit `kernel` option matches one of the known kernels then `arm_64bit` will be set accordingly.

NOTE: 64-bit kernels may be uncompressed image files or a gzip archive of an image (which can still be called kernel8.img; the bootloader will recognize the archive from the signature bytes at the beginning).

NOTE: The 64-bit kernel will only work on the Raspberry Pi 3, 3+, 4, 400, Zero 2 W and 2B rev 1.2, and Raspberry Pi Compute Modules 3, 3+ and 4.

=== `ramfsfile`

`ramfsfile` is the optional filename on the boot partition of a `ramfs` to load. 

NOTE: Newer firmware supports the loading of multiple `ramfs` files. You should separate the multiple file names with commas, taking care not to exceed the 80-character line length limit. All the loaded files are concatenated in memory and treated as a single `ramfs` blob. More information is available https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?f=63&t=10532[on the forums].

=== `ramfsaddr`

`ramfsaddr` is the memory address to which the `ramfsfile` should be loaded.

=== `initramfs`

The `initramfs` command specifies both the ramfs filename *and* the memory address to which to load it. It performs the actions of both `ramfsfile` and `ramfsaddr` in one parameter. The address can also be `followkernel` (or `0`) to place it in memory after the kernel image. Example values are: `initramfs initramf.gz 0x00800000` or `initramfs init.gz followkernel`. As with `ramfsfile`, newer firmwares allow the loading of multiple files by comma-separating their names.

NOTE: This option uses different syntax from all the other options, and you should not use a `=` character here.

[[disable_poe_fan]]
=== `disable_poe_fan`

By default, a probe on the I2C bus will happen at startup, even when a PoE HAT is not attached. Setting this option to 1 disables control of a PoE HAT fan through I2C (on pins ID_SD & ID_SC). If you are not intending to use a PoE HAT doing this is useful if you need to minimise boot time.

=== `disable_splash`

If `disable_splash` is set to `1`, the rainbow splash screen will not be shown on boot. The default value is `0`.

=== `enable_uart`

`enable_uart=1` (in conjunction with `console=serial0` in `cmdline.txt`) requests that the kernel creates a serial console, accessible using GPIOs 14 and 15 (pins 8 and 10 on the 40-pin header). Editing `cmdline.txt` to remove the line `quiet` enables boot messages from the kernel to also appear there. See also `uart_2ndstage`.

=== `force_eeprom_read`

Set this option to `0` to prevent the firmware from trying to read an I2C HAT EEPROM (connected to pins ID_SD & ID_SC) at powerup. See also xref:config_txt.adoc#disable_poe_fan[`disable_poe_fan`].

[[os_prefix]]
=== `os_prefix`

`os_prefix` is an optional setting that allows you to choose between multiple versions of the kernel and Device Tree files installed on the same card. Any value in `os_prefix` is prepended to (stuck in front of) the name of any operating system files loaded by the firmware, where "operating system files" is defined to mean kernels, initramfs, cmdline.txt, .dtbs and overlays. The prefix would commonly be a directory name, but it could also be part of the filename such as "test-". For this reason, directory prefixes must include the trailing `/` character.

In an attempt to reduce the chance of a non-bootable system, the firmware first tests the supplied prefix value for viability - unless the expected kernel and .dtb can be found at the new location/name, the prefix is ignored (set to ""). A special case of this viability test is applied to overlays, which will only be loaded from `+${os_prefix}${overlay_prefix}+` (where the default value of <<overlay_prefix,`overlay_prefix`>> is "overlays/") if `+${os_prefix}${overlay_prefix}README+` exists, otherwise it ignores `os_prefix` and treats overlays as shared.

(The reason the firmware checks for the existence of key files rather than directories when checking prefixes is twofold - the prefix may not be a directory, and not all boot methods support testing for the existence of a directory.)

NOTE: Any user-specified OS file can bypass all prefixes by using an absolute path (with respect to the boot partition) - just start the file path with a `/`, e.g. `kernel=/my_common_kernel.img`.

See also <<overlay_prefix,`overlay_prefix`>> and xref:legacy_config_txt.adoc#upstream_kernel[`upstream_kernel`].

=== `otg_mode` (Raspberry Pi 4 Only)

USB On-The-Go (often abbreviated to OTG) is a feature that allows supporting USB devices with an appropriate OTG cable to configure themselves as USB hosts. On older Raspberry Pis, a single USB 2 controller was used in both USB host and device mode.

Raspberry Pi 4B and Raspberry Pi 400 (not CM4 or CM4IO) add a high performance USB 3 controller, attached via PCIe, to drive the main USB ports. The legacy USB 2 controller is still available on the USB-C power connector for use as a device (`otg_mode=0`, the default).

`otg_mode=1` requests that a more capable XHCI USB 2 controller is used as another host controller on that USB-C connector. 

NOTE: Because CM4 and CM4IO don't include the external USB 3 controller, Raspberry Pi OS images set `otg_mode=1` on CM4 for better performance.

[[overlay_prefix]]
=== `overlay_prefix`

Specifies a subdirectory/prefix from which to load overlays - defaults to `overlays/` (note the trailing `/`). If used in conjunction with <<os_prefix,`os_prefix`>>, the `os_prefix` comes before the `overlay_prefix`, i.e. `dtoverlay=disable-bt` will attempt to load `+${os_prefix}${overlay_prefix}disable-bt.dtbo+`.

NOTE: Unless `+${os_prefix}${overlay_prefix}README+` exists, overlays are shared with the main OS (i.e. `os_prefix` is ignored).
