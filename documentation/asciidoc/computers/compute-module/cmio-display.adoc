== Attach the official 7-inch display

Update your system software and firmware to the latest version before starting.
Compute Modules mostly use the same process, but sometimes physical differences force changes for a particular model.

=== Connect a display to DISP1

NOTE: The Raspberry Pi Zero camera cable cannot be used as an alternative to the RPI-DISPLAY adapter. The two cables have distinct wiring.

To connect a display to DISP1:

. Disconnect the Compute Module from power.
. Connect the display to the DISP1 port on the Compute Module IO board through the 22W to 15W display adapter.
. _(CM1, CM3, CM3+, and CM4S only)_: Connect the following GPIO pins with jumper cables:
  * `0` to `CD1_SDA`
  * `1` to `CD1_SCL`

. Reconnect the Compute Module to power.
. Add the following line to xref:../computers/config_txt.adoc#what-is-config-txt[`/boot/firmware/config.txt`]:
+
[source,ini]
----
dtoverlay=vc4-kms-dsi-7inch
----
. Reboot your Compute Module with `sudo reboot`. Your device should detect and begin displaying output to your display.

=== Connect a display to DISP0

To connect a display to DISP0:

. Connect the display to the DISP0 port on the Compute Module IO board through the 22W to 15W display adapter.
. _(CM1, CM3, CM3+, and CM4S only)_: Connect the following GPIO pins with jumper cables:
  * `28` to `CD0_SDA`
  * `29` to `CD0_SCL`

. Reconnect the Compute Module to power.
. Add the following line to `/boot/firmware/config.txt`:
+
[source,ini]
----
dtoverlay=vc4-kms-dsi-7inch
----
. Reboot your Compute Module with `sudo reboot`. Your device should detect and begin displaying output to your display.

=== Disable touchscreen

The touchscreen requires no additional configuration. Connect it to your Compute Module, and both the touchscreen element and display should work once successfully detected.

To disable the touchscreen element, but still use the display, add the following line to `/boot/firmware/config.txt`:

[source,ini]
----
disable_touchscreen=1
----

=== Disable display

To entirely ignore the display when connected, add the following line to `/boot/firmware/config.txt`:

[source,ini]
----
ignore_lcd=1
----

== Attaching the Touch Display 2 LCD panel

Touch Display 2 is a 720x1280 7" LCD display designed specifically for Raspberry Pi devices (see https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/touch-display-2/). It connects in much the same way as the original touch display, but the software setup on Compute Modules is slightly different as it uses a different display driver. See xref:../accessories/touch-display-2.adoc[Touch Display 2] for connection details.

Edit the /boot/firmware/config.txt file and add the following to enable Touch Display 2 on DSI1.

[source,ini]
----
dtoverlay=vc4-kms-dsi-ili9881-7inch
----

To use DSI0 use the following:

[source,ini]
----
dtoverlay=vc4-kms-dsi-ili9881-7inch,dsi0
