NOTE: Schematics are not available for the Compute Module 4, but are available for the IO board. Schematics for the CMIO4 board are included in the datasheet.

There is also a KiCad PCB design set available:

****
This whitepaper is for those who wish to move from using a Raspberry Pi Compute Module (CM) 1 or 3 to a Raspberry Pi CM 4.

From a software perspective, the move from Raspberry Pi CM 1/3 to Raspberry Pi CM 4 is relatively painless, as Raspberry Pi OS should work on all platforms.

****
The Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM 4) is available in a number of different hardware configurations. Sometimes it may be necessary to disable some of these features when they are not required.

This document describes how to disable various hardware interfaces, in both hardware and software, and how to reduce the amount of memory used by the Linux operating system (OS).
