=== Compute Module IO Board schematics

The Compute Module IO Board (CMIO) provides a variety of interfaces for CM1, CM3, CM3+, and CM4S. The Compute Module IO Board comes in two variants: Version 1 and Version 3. Version 1 is only compatible with CM1. Version 3 is compatible with CM1, CM3, CM3+, and CM4S. Compute Module IO Board Version 3 is sometimes written as the shorthand CMIO3. To learn more about CMIO1 and CMIO3, see the following documents:

* https://pip.raspberrypi.com/documents/RP-008256-DS[Schematics for CMIO]
* https://pip.raspberrypi.com/documents/RP-008376-DS[Design documents for CMIO Version 1.2 (CMIO/CMIO1)]
* https://pip.raspberrypi.com/documents/RP-008377-DS[Design documents for CMIO Version 3.0 (CMIO3)]
