== Flashing the Compute Module eMMC

The Compute Module has an on-board eMMC device connected to the primary SD card interface. This guide explains how to write data to the eMMC storage using a Compute Module IO board.

Please also read the section in the xref:compute-module.adoc#datasheets-and-schematics[Compute Module Datasheets]

IMPORTANT: For mass provisioning of CM3, CM3+ and CM4 the https://github.com/raspberrypi/cmprovision[Raspberry Pi Compute Module Provisioning System] is recommended.

=== Steps to Flash the eMMC 

To flash the Compute Module eMMC, you either need a Linux system (a Raspberry Pi is recommended, or Ubuntu on a PC) or a Windows system (Windows 10 is recommended).

NOTE: Due to a bug in Compute Module 1, it is not possible to flash its eMMC from a Mac.

NOTE: There is a bug in the Compute Module 1 bootloader which returns a slightly incorrect USB packet to the host. A small number of USB host controllers object to this and cannot be used to flash a Compute Module 1.

=== Setting up the CMIO board

==== Compute Module 4

Ensure the Compute Module is fitted correctly on the IO board: It should lie flat on the IO board.

* Make sure that `nRPI_BOOT`, which is on J2 (`disable eMMC Boot`) on the IO board, has a jumper fitted.
* Use a micro USB cable to connect the micro USB slave port J11 on IO board to the host device.
* Do not power up yet.

==== Compute Module 1 and 3

Ensure the Compute Module itself is correctly installed on the IO board. It should lie parallel with the board, with the engagement clips clicked into place.

* Make sure that J4 (USB SLAVE BOOT ENABLE) is set to the 'EN' position.
* Use a micro USB cable to connect the micro USB slave port J15 on IO board to the host device.
* Do not power up yet.

==== For Windows Users

Under Windows, an installer is available to install the required drivers and boot tool automatically. Alternatively, a user can compile and run it using Cygwin and/or install the drivers manually.

==== Windows Installer

For those who just want to enable the Compute Module eMMC as a mass storage device under Windows, the stand-alone installer is the recommended option. This installer has been tested on Windows 10 32-bit and 64-bit, and Windows XP 32-bit.

Please ensure you are not writing to any USB devices whilst the installer is running.

. Download and run the https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot/raw/master/win32/rpiboot_setup.exe[Windows installer] to install the drivers and boot tool.
. Plug your host PC USB into the USB SLAVE port, making sure you have setup the board as described above.
. Apply power to the board; Windows should now find the hardware and install the driver.
. Once the driver installation is complete, run the `RPiBoot.exe` tool that was previously installed.
. After a few seconds, the Compute Module eMMC will pop up under Windows as a disk (USB mass storage device).

==== Building `rpiboot` on your host system.

Instructions for building and running the latest release of `rpiboot` are documented in the https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot/blob/master/Readme.md#building[usbboot readme] on Github.

==== Writing to the eMMC (Windows)

After `rpiboot` completes, a new USB mass storage drive will appear in Windows. We recommend using https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/[Raspberry Pi Imager] to write images to the drive.

Make sure J4 (USB SLAVE BOOT ENABLE) / J2 (nRPI_BOOT) is set to the disabled position and/or nothing is plugged into the USB slave port. Power cycling the IO board should now result in the Compute Module booting from eMMC.

==== Writing to the eMMC (Linux)

After `rpiboot` completes, you will see a new device appear; this is commonly `/dev/sda` on a Raspberry Pi but it could be another location such as `/dev/sdb`, so check in `/dev/` or run `lsblk` before running `rpiboot` so you can see what changes.

You now need to write a raw OS image (such as https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/#raspberry-pi-os-32-bit[Raspberry Pi OS]) to the device. Note the following command may take some time to complete, depending on the size of the image: (Change `/dev/sdX` to the appropriate device.)

[,bash]
----
sudo dd if=raw_os_image_of_your_choice.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4MiB
----

Once the image has been written, unplug and re-plug the USB; you should see two partitions appear (for Raspberry Pi OS) in `/dev`. In total, you should see something similar to this:

[,bash]
----
/dev/sdX    <- Device
/dev/sdX1   <- First partition (FAT)
/dev/sdX2   <- Second partition (Linux filesystem)
----

The `/dev/sdX1` and `/dev/sdX2` partitions can now be mounted normally.

Make sure J4 (USB SLAVE BOOT ENABLE) / J2 (nRPI_BOOT) is set to the disabled position and/or nothing is plugged into the USB slave port. Power cycling the IO board should now result in the Compute Module booting from eMMC.

[[cm4bootloader]]
=== Compute Module 4 Bootloader

The default bootloader configuration on CM4 is designed to support bringup and development on a https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4-io-board/[Compute Module 4 IO board] and the software version flashed at manufacture may be older than the latest release. For final products please consider:-

* Selecting and verifying a specific bootloader release. The version in the `usbboot` repo is always a recent stable release.
* Configuring the boot device (e.g. network boot). See `BOOT_ORDER` section in the xref:raspberry-pi.adoc#raspberry-pi-4-bootloader-configuration[bootloader configuration] guide.
* Enabling hardware write protection on the bootloader EEPROM to ensure that the bootloader can't be modified on remote/inaccessible products.

NOTE: The Compute Module 4 ROM never runs `recovery.bin` from SD/EMMC and the `rpi-eeprom-update` service is not enabled by default. This is necessary because the EMMC is not removable and an invalid `recovery.bin` file would prevent the system from booting. This can be overridden and used with `self-update` mode where the bootloader can be updated from USB MSD or Network boot. However, `self-update` mode is not an atomic update and therefore not safe in the event of a power failure whilst the EEPROM was being updated.

==== Flashing NVMe / other storage devices.
The new Linux-based https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot/blob/master/mass-storage-gadget/README.md[mass-storage gadget] supports flashing of NVMe, EMMC and USB block devices. This is normally faster than using the `rpiboot` firmware driver and also provides a UART console to the device for easier debug.

==== Modifying the bootloader configuration

To modify the CM4 bootloader configuration:-

* cd `usbboot/recovery`
* Replace `pieeprom.original.bin` if a specific bootloader release is required.
* Edit the default `boot.conf` bootloader configuration file. Typically, at least the BOOT_ORDER must be updated:-
 ** For network boot `BOOT_ORDER=0xf2`
 ** For SD/EMMC boot `BOOT_ORDER=0xf1`
 ** For USB boot failing over to EMMC `BOOT_ORDER=0xf15`
* Run `./update-pieeprom.sh` to update the EEPROM image `pieeprom.bin` image file.
* If EEPROM write protection is required then edit `config.txt` and add `eeprom_write_protect=1`. Hardware write-protection must be enabled via software and then locked by pulling the `EEPROM_nWP` pin low.
* Run `../rpiboot -d .` to update the bootloader using the updated EEPROM image `pieeprom.bin`

The pieeprom.bin file is now ready to be flashed to the Compute Module 4.

==== Flashing the bootloader EEPROM - Compute Module 4

To flash the bootloader EEPROM follow the same hardware setup as for flashing the EMMC but also ensure EEPROM_nWP is NOT pulled low. Once complete `EEPROM_nWP` may be pulled low again.

[,bash]
----
# Writes recovery/pieeprom.bin to the bootloader EEPROM.
./rpiboot -d recovery
----

=== Known Issue

For a small percentage of Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3s, booting problems have been reported. We have traced these back to the method used to create the FAT32 partition; we believe the problem is due to a difference in timing between the BCM2835/6/7 and the newer eMMC devices. The following method of creating the partition is a reliable solution in our hands.

[,bash]
----
sudo parted /dev/<device>
(parted) mkpart primary fat32 4MiB 64MiB
(parted) q
sudo mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/<device>
sudo cp -r <files>/* <mountpoint>
