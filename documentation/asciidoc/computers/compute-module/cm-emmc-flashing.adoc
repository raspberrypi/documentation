== Flashing the Compute Module eMMC

The Compute Module has an on-board eMMC device connected to the primary SD card interface. This guide explains how to write data to the eMMC storage using a Compute Module IO board.

Please also read the section in the xref:compute-module.adoc#datasheets-and-schematics[Compute Module Datasheets]

=== Steps to Flash the eMMC 

To flash the Compute Module eMMC, you either need a Linux system (a Raspberry Pi is recommended, or Ubuntu on a PC) or a Windows system (Windows 10 is recommended). For BCM2837 (CM3), a bug which affected the Mac has been fixed, so this will also work.

NOTE: There is a bug in the BCM2835 (CM1) bootloader which returns a slightly incorrect USB packet to the host. Most USB hosts seem to ignore this benign bug and work fine; we do, however, see some USB ports that don't work due to this bug. We don't quite understand why some ports fail, as it doesn't seem to be correlated with whether they are USB2 or USB3 (we have seen both types working), but it's likely to be specific to the host controller and driver. This bug has been fixed in BCM2837.

=== Setting up the CMIO board

==== Compute Module 4

Ensure the Compute Module is fitted correctly installed on the IO board. It should lie flat on the IO board.

* Make sure that `nRPI_BOOT` which is on J2 (`disable eMMC Boot`) on the IO board jumper is fitted
* Use a micro USB cable to connect the micro USB slave port J11 on IO board to the host device.
* Do not power up yet.

==== Compute Module 1 and 3

Ensure the Compute Module itself is correctly installed on the IO board. It should lie parallel with the board, with the engagement clips clicked into place.

* Make sure that J4 (USB SLAVE BOOT ENABLE) is set to the 'EN' position.
* Use a micro USB cable to connect the micro USB slave port J15 on IO board to the host device.
* Do not power up yet.

==== For Windows Users

Under Windows, an installer is available to install the required drivers and boot tool automatically. Alternatively, a user can compile and run it using Cygwin and/or install the drivers manually.

==== Windows Installer

For those who just want to enable the Compute Module eMMC as a mass storage device under Windows, the stand-alone installer is the recommended option. This installer has been tested on Windows 10 32-bit and 64-bit, and Windows XP 32-bit.

Please ensure you are not writing to any USB devices whilst the installer is running.

. Download and run the https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot/raw/master/win32/rpiboot_setup.exe[Windows installer] to install the drivers and boot tool.
. Plug your host PC USB into the USB SLAVE port, making sure you have setup the board as described above.
. Apply power to the board; Windows should now find the hardware and install the driver.
. Once the driver installation is complete, run the `RPiBoot.exe` tool that was previously installed.
. After a few seconds, the Compute Module eMMC will pop up under Windows as a disk (USB mass storage device).

==== Building `rpiboot` on your host system (Cygwin/Linux)

We will be using Git to get the rpiboot source code, so ensure Git is installed. In Cygwin, use the Cygwin installer. On a Pi or other Debian-based Linux machine, use the following command:

[,bash]
----
sudo apt install git
----

Git may produce an error if the date is not set correctly. On a Raspberry Pi, enter the following to correct this:

[,bash]
----
sudo date MMDDhhmm
----

where `MM` is the month, `DD` is the date, and `hh` and `mm` are hours and minutes respectively.

Clone the `usbboot` tool repository:

[,bash]
----
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot
cd usbboot
----

`libusb` must be installed. If you are using Cygwin, please make sure `libusb` is installed as previously described. On Raspberry Pi OS or other Debian-based Linux, enter the following command:

[,bash]
----
sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev
----

Now build and install the `usbboot` tool:

[,bash]
----
make
----

Run the `usbboot` tool and it will wait for a connection:

[,bash]
----
sudo ./rpiboot
----

Now plug the host machine into the Compute Module IO board USB slave port and power the CMIO board on. The `rpiboot` tool will discover the Compute Module and send boot code to allow access to the eMMC.

For more information run

----
./rpiboot -h
----

==== Writing to the eMMC (Windows)

After `rpiboot` completes, a new USB mass storage drive will appear in Windows. We recommend following this xref:getting-started.adoc#installing-images-on-windows[guide] and using Win32DiskImager to write images to the drive, rather than trying to use `/dev/sda` etc. from Cygwin.

Make sure J4 (USB SLAVE BOOT ENABLE) / J2 (nRPI_BOOT) is set to the disabled position and/or nothing is plugged into the USB slave port. Power cycling the IO board should now result in the Compute Module booting from eMMC.

==== Writing to the eMMC (Linux)

After `rpiboot` completes, you will see a new device appear; this is commonly `/dev/sda` on a Pi but it could be another location such as `/dev/sdb`, so check in `/dev/` or run `lsblk` before running `rpiboot` so you can see what changes.

You now need to write a raw OS image (such as https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/#raspberry-pi-os-32-bit[Raspberry Pi OS]) to the device. Note the following command may take some time to complete, depending on the size of the image: (Change `/dev/sdX` to the appropriate device.)

[,bash]
----
sudo dd if=raw_os_image_of_your_choice.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4MiB
----

Once the image has been written, unplug and re-plug the USB; you should see two partitions appear (for Raspberry Pi OS) in `/dev`. In total, you should see something similar to this:

[,bash]
----
/dev/sdX    <- Device
/dev/sdX1   <- First partition (FAT)
/dev/sdX2   <- Second partition (Linux filesystem)
----

The `/dev/sdX1` and `/dev/sdX2` partitions can now be mounted normally.

Make sure J4 (USB SLAVE BOOT ENABLE) / J2 (nRPI_BOOT) is set to the disabled position and/or nothing is plugged into the USB slave port. Power cycling the IO board should now result in the Compute Module booting from eMMC.

[[cm4bootloader]]
=== Compute Module 4 Bootloader

The default bootloader configuration on CM4 is designed to support bringup and development on a https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4-io-board/[Compute Module 4 IO board] and the software version flashed at manufacture may be older than the latest release. For final products please consider:-

* Selecting and verifying a specific bootloader release. The version in the `usbboot` repo is always a recent stable release.
* Configuring the boot device (e.g. network boot). See `BOOT_ORDER` section in the xref:raspberry-pi.adoc#raspberry-pi-4-bootloader-configuration[bootloader configuration] guide.
* Enabling hardware write protection on the bootloader EEPROM to ensure that the bootloader can't be modified on remote/inaccessible products.

N.B. The Compute Module 4 ROM never runs `recovery.bin` from SD/EMMC and the `rpi-eeprom-update` service is not enabled by default. This is necessary because the EMMC is not removable and an invalid `recovery.bin` file would prevent the system from booting. This can be overridden and used with `self-update` mode where the bootloader can be updated from USB MSD or Network boot. However, `self-update` mode is not an atomic update and therefore not safe in the event of a power failure whilst the EEPROM was being updated.

==== Modifying the bootloader configuration

To modify the CM4 bootloader configuration:-

* cd `usbboot/recovery`
* Replace `pieeprom.original.bin` if a specific bootloader release is required.
* Edit the default `boot.conf` bootloader configuration file. Typically, at least the BOOT_ORDER must be updated:-
 ** For network boot `BOOT_ORDER=0xf2`
 ** For SD/EMMC boot `BOOT_ORDER=0xf1`
 ** For USB boot failing over to EMMC `BOOT_ORDER=0xf15`
* Run `./update-pieeprom.sh` to update the EEPROM image `pieeprom.bin` image file.
* If EEPROM write protection is required then edit `config.txt` and add `eeprom_write_protect=1`. Hardware write-protection must be enabled via software and then locked by pulling the `EEPROM_nWP` pin low.
* Run `../rpiboot -d .` to update the bootloader using the updated EEPROM image `pieeprom.bin`

The pieeprom.bin file is now ready to be flashed to the Compute Module 4.

==== Flashing the bootloader EEPROM - Compute Module 4

To flash the bootloader EEPROM follow the same hardware setup as for flashing the EMMC but also ensure EEPROM_nWP is NOT pulled low. Once complete `EEPROM_nWP` may be pulled low again.

[,bash]
----
# Writes recovery/pieeprom.bin to the bootloader EEPROM.
./rpiboot -d recovery
----

=== Troubleshooting

For a small percentage of Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3s, booting problems have been reported. We have traced these back to the method used to create the FAT32 partition; we believe the problem is due to a difference in timing between the BCM2835/6/7 and the newer eMMC devices. The following method of creating the partition is a reliable solution in our hands.

[,bash]
----
sudo parted /dev/<device>
(parted) mkpart primary fat32 4MiB 64MiB
(parted) q
sudo mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/<device>
sudo cp -r <files>/* <mountpoint>
