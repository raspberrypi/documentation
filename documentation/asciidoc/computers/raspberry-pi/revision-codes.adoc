== Raspberry Pi revision codes

Each distinct Raspberry Pi model revision has a unique revision code. You can look up a Raspberry Pi's revision code by running:

[source,console]
----
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo
----

The last three lines show the hardware type, the revision code, and the Raspberry Pi's unique serial number. For example:

----
Hardware    : BCM2835
Revision    : a02082
Serial      : 00000000765fc593
----

NOTE: All Raspberry Pi computers report `BCM2835`, even those with BCM2836, BCM2837, BCM2711, and BCM2712 processors. You should not use this string to detect the processor. Decode the revision code using the information below, or `cat /sys/firmware/devicetree/base/model`. Depending on which kernel you're running, your `cpuinfo` might also have a "Model" line, and might not have a "Hardware" line.

=== Old-style revision codes

The first set of Raspberry Pi models were given sequential hex revision codes from `0002` to `0015`:

=== New-style revision codes

With the launch of the Raspberry Pi 2, new-style revision codes were introduced. Rather than being sequential, each bit of the hex code represents a piece of information about the revision:

=== New-style revision codes in use

NOTE: This list is not exhaustive - there may be codes in use that are not in this table. Please see the next section for best practices on using revision codes to identify boards.

// This table is now sorted by Type (from table above), then Revision, then RAM, and finally Code. This is the most likley order-of-manufacture, which means we'll normally just add new revision-codes to the very bottom of the table, without having to worry about re-ordering entries.

=== Using revision codes for board identification

From the command line we can use the following to get the revision code of the board:

[source,console]
----
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep Revision
Revision      : c03111
----

In this example above, we have a hexadecimal revision code of `c03111`. Converting this to binary, we get `0 0 0 000 0 0 1 100 0000 0011 00010001 0001`. Spaces have been inserted to show the borders between each section of the revision code, according to the above table.

Starting from the lowest order bits, the bottom four (0-3) are the board revision number, so this board has a revision of 1. The next eight bits (4-11) are the board type, in this case binary `00010001`, hex `11`, so this is a Raspberry Pi 4B. Using the same process, we can determine that the processor is a BCM2711, the board was manufactured by Sony UK, and it has 4GB of RAM.

==== Getting the revision code in your program

Obviously there are so many programming languages out there it's not possible to give examples for all of them, but here are two quick examples for `C` and `Python`. Both these examples use a system call to run a bash command that gets the `cpuinfo` and pipes the result to `awk` to recover the required revision code. They then use bit operations to extract the `New`, `Model`, and `Memory` fields from the code.


[source,c]
----
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main( int argc, char *argv[] )
{
  FILE *fp;
  char revcode[32];

  fp = popen("cat /proc/cpuinfo | awk '/Revision/ {print $3}'", "r");
  if (fp == NULL)
    exit(1);
  fgets(revcode, sizeof(revcode), fp);
  pclose(fp);

  int code = strtol(revcode, NULL, 16);
  int new = (code >> 23) & 0x1;
  int model = (code >> 4) & 0xff;
  int mem = (code >> 20) & 0x7;

  if (new && model == 0x11 && mem >= 3)  // Note, 3 in the mem field is 2GB
     printf("We are a 4B with at least 2GB of RAM!\n" );

  return 0;
}
----

And the same in Python:

[source,python]
----
import subprocess

cmd = "cat /proc/cpuinfo | awk '/Revision/ {print $3}'"
revcode = subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell=True)

code = int(revcode, 16)  
new = (code >> 23) & 0x1
model = (code >> 4) & 0xff
mem = (code >> 20) & 0x7

if new and model == 0x11 and mem >= 3 : # Note, 3 in the mem field is 2GB
    print("We are a 4B with at least 2GB RAM!")
----

=== Best practices for revision code usage

To avoid problems when new board revisions are created, do not use the revision code (e.g. `c03111`).

A naive implementation uses a list of supported revision codes, comparing the detected code with the list to decide if the device is supported.
This breaks when a new board revision comes out or if the production location changes: each creates a new revision code not in the supported revision code list. This would cause rejections of new revisions of the same board type, despite the fact that they are always backwards-compatible. Every time a new revision appears, you would have to release a new supported revision code list containing the new revision code - an onerous support burden.

Instead, use one of the following approaches:

* Filter by the board-type field (3A, 4B, etc.), which indicates the model, but not the revision.
* Filter by the amount-of-memory field, since RAM vaguely corresponds to the computing power of a board.

For instance, you could limit support to Raspberry Pi 4B models with 2GB of RAM or more.
The examples in the previous section use this recommended approach.

NOTE: Always check bit 23, the 'New' flag, to ensure that the revision code is the new version before checking any other fields.

==== Check Raspberry Pi model and CPU across distributions

Support and formatting for `/proc/cpuinfo` varies across Linux distributions. To check the model or CPU of a Raspberry Pi device on any Linux distribution (including Raspberry Pi OS), check the device tree:

[source,console]
----
$ cat /proc/device-tree/compatible | tr '\0' '\n'
raspberrypi,5-model-b
brcm,bcm2712
----

This outputs two null-separated string values, each containing a comma-separated make and model. For instance, the Raspberry Pi 5 outputs the board and CPU strings above. These correspond to the following values:

* `raspberrypi` (board make)
* `5-model-b` (board model)
* `brcm` (CPU make)
* `bcm2712` (CPU model)

Raspberry Pi models have the following device tree values:
