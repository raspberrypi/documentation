Raspberry Pi 5 has an FPC connector on the right-hand side of the board. This connector breaks out a PCIe Gen 2.0 Ã—1 interface for fast peripherals.

To connect a PCIe https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/hat/hat-plus-specification.pdf[HAT+ device], connect it to your Raspberry Pi. Your Raspberry Pi should automatically detect the device. To connect a non-HAT+ device, connect it to your Raspberry Pi, then <<enable-pcie, manually enable PCIe>>.

For more information about the PCIe FPC connector pinout and other details needed to create third-party devices, accessories, and HATs, see the https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pcie/pcie-connector-standard.pdf[Raspberry Pi Connector for PCIe] standards document. It should be read alongside the https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/hat/hat-plus-specification.pdf[Raspberry Pi HAT+ Specification].

NOTE: Enumeration of PCIe devices behind a switch is https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/1833[not currently supported].

=== Enable PCIe

By default, the PCIe connector is not enabled unless connected to a HAT+ device. To enable the connector, add the following line to `/boot/firmware/config.txt`:

[source,ini]
----
dtparam=pciex1
----

Reboot with `sudo reboot` for the configuration changes to take effect.

NOTE: You can also use the alias `nvme`.

=== Boot from PCIe

By default, Raspberry Pi devices do not boot from PCIe storage. To enable boot from PCIe, change the `BOOT_ORDER` in the bootloader configuration. Edit the EEPROM configuration with the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo rpi-eeprom-config --edit
----

Replace the `BOOT_ORDER` line with the following line:

[source,ini]
----
BOOT_ORDER=0xf416
----

To boot from a non-HAT+ device, also add the following line:

[source,ini]
----
PCIE_PROBE=1
----

After saving your changes, reboot your Raspberry Pi with `sudo reboot` to update the EEPROM.

=== PCIe Gen 3.0

WARNING: The Raspberry Pi 5 is not certified for Gen 3.0 speeds. PCIe Gen 3.0 connections may be unstable.

==== via `config.txt`

The connection is certified for Gen 2.0 speeds (5 GT/sec), but you can force Gen 3.0 (10 GT/sec) speeds. To enable PCIe Gen 3.0 speeds, add the following line to `/boot/firmware/config.txt`:

[source,ini]
----
dtparam=pciex1_gen=3
----

Reboot your Raspberry Pi with `sudo reboot` for these settings to take effect.

==== via `raspi-config`

Run the following command to open the Raspberry Pi Configuration CLI:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo raspi-config
----

Complete the following steps to enable PCIe Gen 3.0 speeds:

. Select `Advanced Options`.
. Select `PCIe Speed`.
. Choose `Yes` to enable PCIe Gen 3 mode.
. Select `Finish` to exit.

Reboot your Raspberry Pi with `sudo reboot` for these settings to take effect.
