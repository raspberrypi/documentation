== NVMe SSD boot

NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory express) is a standard for external storage access over a PCIe bus. You can connect NVMe drives via the PCIe slot on Compute Module 4 IO Board, the M.2 slot on Compute Module 5 IO Board, and Raspberry Pi 5 using an M.2 HAT+ or M.2 HAT+ Compact. With some additional configuration, you can boot from an NVMe drive.

=== Prerequisites

==== Hardware

* NVMe M.2 SSD
* an adapter to convert from PCIe to an M.2 standard.
** For Raspberry Pi 5, we recommend the xref:../accessories/m2-hat-plus.adoc[M.2 HAT+ or M.2 HAT+ Compact], which converts from the Raspberry Pi's *PCIe FFC* slot to an M Key interface.
** For the CM4, search for a "PCI-E 3.0 ×1 lane to M.2 NGFF M-Key SSD NVMe PCI Express adapter card"

To check that your NVMe drive is connected correctly, boot your Raspberry Pi from another storage device (such as an SD card) and run `ls -l /dev/nvme*`. Example output is shown below.

----
crw------- 1 root root 245, 0 Mar  9 14:58 /dev/nvme0
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 259, 0 Mar  9 14:58 /dev/nvme0n1
----

==== Software

First, ensure that your Raspberry Pi runs the latest software. Run the following command to update:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade
----

=== Edit the bootloader boot priority

Use the Raspberry Pi Software Configuration Tool to update the bootloader:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo raspi-config
----

Under `Advanced Options` > `Boot Order`, specify an option that includes NVMe.  It will then write these changes to the bootloader and return to the Config Tool, in which you can `Finish` and reboot.  Your Raspberry Pi will use the new boot order now.

For CM4, use `rpiboot` to update the bootloader. You can find instructions for building `rpiboot` and configuring the IO board to switch the ROM to usbboot mode in the https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot[USB boot GitHub repository].

For versions of CM4 with an eMMC, make sure you have set NVMe first in the boot order. Remember to add the NVMe boot mode `6` to `BOOT_ORDER` in `recovery/boot.conf`.

CM4 Lite automatically boots from NVMe when the SD card slot is empty.

=== NVMe `BOOT_ORDER`

The `BOOT_ORDER` setting in EEPROM configuration controls boot behaviour.
For NVMe boot, use boot mode `6`. For more information, see xref:raspberry-pi.adoc#raspberry-pi-bootloader-configuration[Raspberry Pi bootloader configuration].

=== Example

Below is an example of UART output when the bootloader detects the NVMe drive:

----
Boot mode: SD (01) order f64
Boot mode: USB-MSD (04) order f6
Boot mode: NVME (06) order f
VID 0x144d MN Samsung SSD 970 EVO Plus 250GB
NVME on
----

It will then find a FAT partition and load `start4.elf`:

----
Read start4.elf bytes  2937840 hnd 0x00050287 hash ''
----

It will then load the kernel and boot the OS:

----
MESS:00:00:07.096119:0: brfs: File read: /mfs/sd/kernel8.img
MESS:00:00:07.098682:0: Loading 'kernel8.img' to 0x80000 size 0x1441a00
MESS:00:00:07.146055:0:[    0.000000] Booting Linux on physical CPU 0x0000000000 [0x410fd083]
----

In Linux the SSD appears as `/dev/nvme0` and the "namespace" as `/dev/nvme0n1`. There will be two partitions `/dev/nvme0n1p1` (FAT) and `/dev/nvme0n1p2` (EXT4). Use `lsblk` to check the partition assignments:

----
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
nvme0n1     259:0    0 232.9G  0 disk
├─nvme0n1p1 259:1    0   256M  0 part /boot/firmware
└─nvme0n1p2 259:2    0 232.6G  0 part /
----

=== Troubleshooting

If the boot process fails, please file an issue on the https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-eeprom[rpi-eeprom GitHub repository], being sure to attach a copy of the console and anything displayed on the screen during boot.
