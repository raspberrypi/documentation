== NVMe SSD Boot

NVMe (non-volatile memory express) is a standard for accessing solid state drives (SSDs) via a PCIe bus. You can connect these drives via the PCIe slot on a Compute Module 4 (CM4) IO board, allowing a CM4 to boot from SSD.

=== Required Hardware

You need an NVMe M.2 SSD. You cannot plug an M.2 SSD directly into the PCIe slot on the IO board - an adaptor is needed. Be careful to get the correct type: a suitable adaptor can be found online by searching for 'PCI-E 3.0 x1 Lane to M.2 NGFF M-Key SSD Nvme PCI Express Adapter Card'.

The latest version of Raspberry Pi OS supports booting from NVMe drives. To check that your NVMe drive is connected correctly, boot Raspberry Pi OS from another drive and run `ls -l /dev/nvme*`; example output is shown below.

----
crw------- 1 root root 245, 0 Mar  9 14:58 /dev/nvme0
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 259, 0 Mar  9 14:58 /dev/nvme0n1
----

If you need to connect the NVMe drive to a PC or Mac you can use a USB adaptor: search for 'NVME PCI-E M-Key Solid State Drive External Enclosure'. The enclosure must support M key SSDs.

=== Required Software

To boot from NVMe you need a recent version of the bootloader (after July 2021), and a recent version of the VideoCore firmware and Raspberry Pi OS Linux kernel. The latest Raspberry Pi OS release has everything you need, so you can use the xref:getting-started.adoc#raspberry-pi-imager[Raspberry Pi Imager] to install the software to your SSD.

==== Bootloader

You might need to use `rpiboot` to update the CM4 bootloader. Instructions for building `rpiboot` and configuring the IO board to switch the ROM to usbboot mode are in the https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot[usbboot Github repository].

Remember to add the NVMe boot mode `6` to BOOT_ORDER in `recovery/boot.conf`.

==== Firmware and kernel

You must have the latest versions of the VideoCore firmware and Raspberry Pi OS Linux kernel to boot directly from an NVMe SSD disk. The Raspberry Pi Bullseye and Buster Legacy releases have everything needed.

If you are using CM4 lite, remove the SD card and the board will boot from the NVMe disk. For versions of CM4 with an eMMC, make sure you have set NVMe first in the boot order.

==== NVMe BOOT_ORDER

This boot behaviour is controlled via the `BOOT_ORDER` setting in the EEPROM configuration: we have added a new boot mode `6` for NVMe. See xref:raspberry-pi.adoc#raspberry-pi-4-bootloader-configuration[Raspberry Pi 4 Bootloader Configuration].

Below is an example of UART output when the bootloader detects the NVMe drive:

----
Boot mode: SD (01) order f64
Boot mode: USB-MSD (04) order f6
Boot mode: NVME (06) order f
VID 0x144d MN Samsung SSD 970 EVO Plus 250GB
NVME on
----

It will then find a FAT partition and load `start4.elf`:

----
Read start4.elf bytes  2937840 hnd 0x00050287 hash ''
----

It will then load the kernel and boot the OS:

----

MESS:00:00:07.098682:0: Loading 'kernel8.img' to 0x80000 size 0x1441a00
MESS:00:00:07.146055:0:[    0.000000] Booting Linux on physical CPU 0x0000000000 [0x410fd083]
----

In Linux the SSD appears as `/dev/nvme0` and the "namespace" as `/dev/nvme0n1`. There will be two partitions `/dev/nvme0n1p1` (FAT) and `/dev/nvme0n1p2` (EXT4). Use `lsblk` to check the partition assignments:

----
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
nvme0n1     259:0    0 232.9G  0 disk
├─nvme0n1p1 259:1    0   256M  0 part /boot
└─nvme0n1p2 259:2    0 232.6G  0 part /
----

=== Troubleshooting

If the boot process fails, please file an issue on the https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-eeprom[rpi-eeprom Github repository], including a copy of the console and anything displayed on the screen during boot.
