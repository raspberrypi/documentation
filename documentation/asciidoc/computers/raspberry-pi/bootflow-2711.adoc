== Raspberry Pi 4 Boot Flow

The main difference between this and previous products is that the second stage bootloader is loaded from an SPI flash xref:raspberry-pi.adoc#raspberry-pi-4-boot-eeprom[EEPROM] instead of the `bootcode.bin` file on previous products.

=== First Stage Bootloader

The boot flow for the ROM (first stage) is as follows:-

* BCM2711 SoC powers up
* Read OTP to determine if the `nRPIBOOT` GPIO is configured
* If `nRPIBOOT` GPIO is high or OTP does NOT define `nRPIBOOT` GPIO
 ** Check OTP to see if `recovery.bin` can be loaded from SD/EMMC
  *** If SD recovery.bin is enabled then check primary SD/EMMC for `recovery.bin`
   **** Success - run `recovery.bin` and update the SPI EEPROM
   **** Fail - continue
 ** Check SPI EEPROM for second stage loader
  *** Success - run second stage bootloader
  *** Fail - continue
* While True
 ** Attempt to load recovery.bin from xref:compute-module.adoc#flashing-the-compute-module-emmc[USB device boot]
  *** Success - run `recovery.bin` and update the SPI EEPROM or switch to USB mass storage device mode
  *** Fail - retry USB device boot

NOTE: Currently only CM4 reserves a GPIO for `nRPIBOOT`.

NOTE: `recovery.bin` is a minimal second stage program used to reflash the bootloader SPI EEPROM image.

=== Second Stage Bootloader

This section describes the high-level flow of the second stage bootloader.

Please see the xref:raspberry-pi.adoc#raspberry-pi-4-bootloader-configuration[bootloader configuration] page for more information about each boot mode and the xref:configuration.adoc#the-boot-folder[boot folder] page for a description of the GPU firmware files loaded by this stage.

* Initialise clocks and SDRAM
* Read the EEPROM configuration file
* Check `PM_RSTS` register to determine if HALT is requested
 ** Check `POWER_OFF_ON_HALT` and `WAKE_ON_GPIO` EEPROM configuration settings.
 ** If `POWER_OFF_ON_HALT` is `1` and `WAKE_ON_GPIO` is `0` then
  *** Use PMIC to power off system
 ** else if `WAKE_ON_GPIO` is `1`
  *** Enable fall-edge interrupts on GPIO3 to wake-up if GPIO3 is pulled low
 ** sleep
* While True
 ** Read the next boot-mode from the BOOT_ORDER parameter in the EEPROM config file.
 ** If boot-mode == `RESTART`
  *** Jump back to the first boot-mode in the `BOOT_ORDER` field
 ** else if boot-mode == `STOP`
  *** Display start.elf not found xref:configuration.adoc#led-warning-flash-codes[error pattern] and wait forever.
 ** else if boot-mode == `SD CARD`
  *** Attempt to load firmware from the SD card
   **** Success - run the firmware
   **** Failure - continue
 ** else if boot-mode == `NETWORK` then
  *** Use DHCP protocol to request IP address
  *** Load firmware from the DHCP or statically defined TFTP server
  *** If the firmware is not found or a timeout or network error occurs then continue
 ** else if boot-mode == `USB-MSD` or boot-mode == `BCM-USB-MSD` then
  *** While USB discover has not timed out
   **** Check for USB mass storage devices
   **** If a new mass storage device is found then
    ***** For each drive (LUN)
     ****** Attempt to load firmware
      ******* Success - run the firmware
      ******* Failed - advance to next LUN
 ** else if boot-mode == `NVME` then
  *** Scan PCIe for an NVMe device and if found
   **** Attempt to load firmware from the NVMe device
    ***** Success - run the firmware
    ***** Failure - continue
 ** else if boot-mode == `RPIBOOT` then
  *** Attempt to load firmware using USB device mode from the USB OTG port - see https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot[usbboot]. There is no timeout for `RPIBOOT` mode.

=== Bootloader Updates

The bootloader may also be updated before the firmware is started if a `pieeprom.upd` file is found. Please see the xref:raspberry-pi.adoc#raspberry-pi-4-boot-eeprom[bootloader EEPROM] page for more information about bootloader updates.
