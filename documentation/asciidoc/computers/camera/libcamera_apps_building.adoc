=== Building `libcamera` and `libcamera-apps`

Building `libcamera` and `libcamera-apps` for yourself can bring the following benefits.

* You can pick up the latest enhancements and features.

* `libcamera-apps` can be compiled with extra optimisation for Raspberry Pi 3 and Raspberry Pi 4 devices running a 32-bit OS.

* You can include the various optional OpenCV and/or TFLite post-processing stages (or add your own).

* You can customise or add your own applications derived from `libcamera-apps`.

NOTE: When building on a Raspberry Pi with 1GB or less of RAM, there is a risk that the device may run out of swap and fail. We recommend either increasing the amount of swap, or building with fewer threads (the `-j` option to `ninja` and to `make`).

==== Building `libcamera-apps` without rebuilding `libcamera`

You can rebuild `libcamera-apps` _without_ first rebuilding the whole of `libcamera` and `libepoxy`. If you do not need support for the GLES/EGL preview window then `libepoxy` can be omitted entirely. Mostly this will include Raspberry Pi OS Lite users, and they must be sure to use `-Denable_egl=false` when running `meson setup` later. These users should run:

----
sudo apt install -y libcamera-dev libjpeg-dev libtiff5-dev
----

All other users should execute:

----
sudo apt install -y libcamera-dev libepoxy-dev libjpeg-dev libtiff5-dev
----

If you want to use the Qt preview window, please also execute

----
sudo apt install -y qtbase5-dev libqt5core5a libqt5gui5 libqt5widgets5
----

If you want xref:camera_software.adoc#libav-integration-with-libcamera-vid[libav] support in `libcamera-vid`, additional libraries must be installed:

----
sudo apt install libavcodec-dev libavdevice-dev libavformat-dev libswresample-dev
----

Now proceed directly to the instructions for xref:camera_software.adoc#building-libcamera-apps[building `libcamera-apps`]. Raspberry Pi OS Lite users should check that _git_ is installed first (`sudo apt install -y git`).

==== Building `libcamera`

Rebuilding `libcamera` from scratch should be necessary only if you need the latest features that may not yet have reached the `apt` repositories, or if you need to customise its behaviour in some way.

First install all the necessary dependencies for `libcamera`.

NOTE: Raspberry Pi OS Lite users will first need to install the following additional packages if they have not done so previously:

----
sudo apt install -y python3-pip git
sudo pip3 install jinja2
----

All users should then install the following:

----
sudo apt install -y libboost-dev
sudo apt install -y libgnutls28-dev openssl libtiff5-dev pybind11-dev
sudo apt install -y qtbase5-dev libqt5core5a libqt5gui5 libqt5widgets5
sudo apt install -y meson
sudo apt install -y cmake
sudo pip3 install pyyaml ply
sudo pip3 install --upgrade meson
----

In the `meson` commands below we have enabled the _gstreamer_ plugin. If you _do not_ need this you can set `-Dgstreamer=disabled` instead and the next pair of dependencies will not be required. But if you do leave _gstreamer_ enabled, then you will need the following:

----
sudo apt install -y libglib2.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev
----

Now we can check out and build `libcamera` itself. We check out Raspberry Pi's fork of libcamera which tracks the official repository but lets us control exactly when we pick up new features.

----
cd
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/libcamera.git
cd libcamera
----

Next we recommend that Raspberry Pi OS Lite users run

----
meson build --buildtype=release -Dpipelines=raspberrypi -Dipas=raspberrypi -Dv4l2=true -Dgstreamer=enabled -Dtest=false -Dlc-compliance=disabled -Dcam=disabled -Dqcam=disabled -Ddocumentation=disabled -Dpycamera=enabled
----

Users of Raspberry Pi OS can instead use

----
meson build --buildtype=release -Dpipelines=raspberrypi -Dipas=raspberrypi -Dv4l2=true -Dgstreamer=enabled -Dtest=false -Dlc-compliance=disabled -Dcam=disabled -Dqcam=enabled -Ddocumentation=disabled -Dpycamera=enabled
----

NOTE: As of 6th May 2023, there has been a directory restructuring in the upstream libcamera git tree (https://git.libcamera.org/). If users are building libcamera from this tree, please replace `-Dpipelines=raspberrypi -Dipas=raspberrypi` with `-Dpipelines=rpi/vc4 -Dipas=rpi/vc4` in the above commands. This directory restructuring has not yet made it into the Raspberry Pi libcamera repo (https://github.com/raspberrypi/libcamera.git), so the above commands should be used without modifications if using that repo.

The only difference is that the latter also builds the `qcam` test application, which has dependencies on Qt and a desktop environment (after completing the `libcamera` build users can run `build/src/qcam/qcam` to verify that `libcamera` is functioning correctly).

To complete the `libcamera` build, please run

----
ninja -C build   # use -j 2 on Raspberry Pi 3 or earlier devices
sudo ninja -C build install
----

NOTE: At the time of writing `libcamera` does not yet have a stable binary interface. Therefore, if you have rebuilt `libcamera` we recommend continuing and rebuilding `libcamera-apps` from scratch too.

==== Building `libepoxy`

Rebuilding `libepoxy` should not normally be necessary as this library changes only very rarely. If you do want to build it from scratch, however, please follow the instructions below.

Start by installing the necessary dependencies.

----
sudo apt install -y libegl1-mesa-dev
----

Next, check out and build `libepoxy`.

----
cd
git clone https://github.com/anholt/libepoxy.git
cd libepoxy
mkdir _build
cd _build
meson
ninja
sudo ninja install
----

==== Building `libcamera-apps`

First fetch the necessary dependencies for `libcamera-apps`.

----
sudo apt install -y cmake libboost-program-options-dev libdrm-dev libexif-dev
sudo pip3 install ninja meson
----

The `libcamera-apps` build process begins with the following:

----
cd
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/libcamera-apps.git
cd libcamera-apps
----

At this point you will need to run `meson setup` after deciding what extra flags to pass it. The valid flags are:

* `-Dneon_flags=armv8-neon` - you may supply this when building for Raspberry Pi 3 or Raspberry Pi 4 devices running a 32-bit OS. Some post-processing features may run more quickly.

* `-Denable_libav=true` or `-Denable_libav=false` - this enables or disables the libav encoder integration.

* `-Denable_drm=true` or `-Denable_drm=false` - this enables or disables the DRM/KMS preview rendering. This is what implements the preview window when a desktop environment is not running.

* `-Denable_egl=true` or `-Denable_egl=false` - this enables or disables the desktop environment preview. You should disable this if your system does not have a desktop environment installed.

* `-Denable_qt=true` or `-Denable_qt=false` - this enables or disables support for the Qt-based implementation of the preview window. You should disable it if you do not have a desktop environment installed, or if you have no intention of using the Qt-based preview window. The Qt-based preview is normally not recommended because it is computationally very expensive, however it does work with X display forwarding.

* `-Denable_opencv=true` or `-Denable_opencv=false` - you may choose one of these to force OpenCV-based post-processing stages to be linked (or not). If you enable them, then OpenCV must be installed on your system. Normally they will be built by default if OpenCV is available.

* `-Denable_tflite=true` or `-Denable_tflite=false` - choose one of these to enable TensorFlow Lite post-processing stages (or not). By default they will not be enabled. If you enable them then TensorFlow Lite must be available on your system. Depending on how you have built and/or installed TFLite, you may need to tweak the `meson.build` file in the `post_processing_stages` directory.

For Raspberry Pi OS users we recommend the following `meson setup` command:

----
meson setup build -Denable_libav=true -Denable_drm=true -Denable_egl=true -Denable_qt=true -Denable_opencv=false -Denable_tflite=false
----

and for Raspberry Pi OS Lite users:

----
meson setup build -Denable_libav=false -Denable_drm=true -Denable_egl=false -Denable_qt=false -Denable_opencv=false -Denable_tflite=false
----

In both cases, consider `-Dneon_flags=armv8-neon` if you are using a 32-bit OS on a Raspberry Pi 3 or Raspberry Pi 4. Consider `-Denable_opencv=true` if you have installed _OpenCV_ and wish to use OpenCV-based post-processing stages. Finally also consider `-Denable_tflite=true` if you have installed _TensorFlow Lite_ and wish to use it in post-processing stages.

After executing the `meson setup` command of your choice, the whole process concludes with the following:

----
meson compile -C build # use -j1 on Raspberry Pi 3 or earlier devices
sudo meson install -C build
sudo ldconfig # this is only necessary on the first build
----

NOTE: If you are using an image where `libcamera-apps` have been previously installed as an `apt` package, and you want to run the new `libcamera-apps` executables from the same terminal window where you have just built and installed them, you may need to run `hash -r` to be sure to pick up the new ones over the system supplied ones.

Finally, if you have not already done so, please be sure to follow the `dtoverlay` and display driver instructions in the  xref:camera_software.adoc#getting-started[Getting Started section] (and rebooting if you changed anything there).
