== `libcamera` and `libcamera-apps`

[IMPORTANT]
====
Raspberry Pi has transitioned from a legacy camera software stack based on proprietary Broadcom GPU code to an open-source stack based on `libcamera`. As such, the old _Raspicam_ stack (`raspistill`, `raspivid`, etc.) is no longer supported.

=== Introduction

`libcamera` is a new software library aimed at supporting complex camera systems directly from the Linux operating system. In the case of the Raspberry Pi it enables us to drive the camera system directly from open source code running on ARM processors. The proprietary code running on the Broadcom GPU, and to which users have no access at all, is almost completely by-passed.

`libcamera` presents a {cpp} API to applications and works at the level of configuring the camera and then allowing an application to request image frames. These image buffers reside in system memory and can be passed directly to still image encoders (such as JPEG) or to video encoders (such as h.264), though such ancillary functions as encoding images or displaying them are strictly beyond the purview of `libcamera` itself.

For this reason Raspberry Pi supplies a small set of example `libcamera-apps`. These are simple applications, built on top of `libcamera`, and are designed largely to emulate the function of the legacy stack built on Broadcom's proprietary GPU code (some users will recognise these legacy applications as `raspistill` and `raspivid`). The applications we provide are:

* _libcamera-hello_ A simple "hello world" application which starts a camera preview stream and displays it on the screen.
* _libcamera-jpeg_ A simple application to run a preview window and then capture high resolution still images.
* _libcamera-still_ A more complex still image capture application which emulates more of the features of the original `raspistill` application.
* _libcamera-vid_ A video capture application.
* _libcamera-raw_ A basic application for capturing raw (unprocessed Bayer) frames directly from the sensor.
* _libcamera-detect_ This application is not built by default, but users can build it if they have TensorFlow Lite installed on their Raspberry Pi. It captures JPEG images when certain objects are detected.

Raspberry Pi's `libcamera-apps` are not only command line applications that make it easy to capture images and video from the camera, they are also examples of how users can create their own libcamera-based applications with custom functionality to suit their own requirements. The source code for the `libcamera-apps` is freely available under a BSD 2-Clause licence at https://github.com/raspberrypi/libcamera-apps[].

==== More about `libcamera`

`libcamera` is an open source Linux community project. More information is available at the https://libcamera.org[`libcamera` website].

The `libcamera` source code can be found and checked out from the https://git.linuxtv.org/libcamera.git/[official libcamera repository], although we work from a https://github.com/raspberrypi/libcamera.git[fork] that lets us control when we get _libcamera_ updates.

Underneath the `libcamera` core, Raspberry Pi provides a custom _pipeline handler_, which is the layer that `libcamera` uses to drive the sensor and ISP (Image Signal Processor) on the Raspberry Pi itself. Also part of this is a collection of well-known _control algorithms_, or _IPAs_ (Image Processing Algorithms) in `libcamera` parlance, such as AEC/AGC (Auto Exposure/Gain Control), AWB (Auto White Balance), ALSC (Auto Lens Shading Correction) and so on.

All this code is open source and now runs on the Raspberry Pi's ARM cores. There is only a very thin layer of code on the GPU which translates Raspberry Pi's own control parameters into register writes for the Broadcom ISP.

Raspberry Pi's implementation of `libcamera` supports not only the four standard Raspberry Pi cameras (the OV5647 or V1 camera, the IMX219 or V2 camera, the IMX477 or HQ camera and the IMX708 or Camera Module 3) but also third party senors such as the IMX290, IMX327, OV9281, IMX378. Raspberry Pi is keen to work with vendors who would like to see their sensors supported directly by `libcamera`.

Moreover, Raspberry Pi supplies a _tuning file_ for each of these sensors which can be edited to change the processing performed by the Raspberry Pi hardware on the raw images received from the image sensor, including aspects like the colour processing, the amount of noise suppression or the behaviour of the control algorithms.
