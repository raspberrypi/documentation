This documentation describes how to use supported camera modules with our software tools. All Raspberry Pi cameras can record high-resolution photographs and full HD 1080p video (or better) with our software tools.

Raspberry Pi produces several official camera modules, including:

* the original 5-megapixel Camera Module 1 (discontinued)
* the 8-megapixel https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-v2/[Camera Module 2], with or without an infrared filter
