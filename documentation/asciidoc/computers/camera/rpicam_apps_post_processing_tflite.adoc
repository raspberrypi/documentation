=== Post-Processing with TensorFlow Lite

==== Prerequisites

These stages require TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) libraries that export the {cpp} API. From Raspberry Pi OS _Trixie_ onwards, Raspberry Pi builds and distributes a TFLite package, which can be installed with the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt install libtensorflow-lite-dev
----

After installing, you must xref:camera_software.adoc#build-libcamera-and-rpicam-apps[recompile `rpicam-apps` with TensorFlow Lite support].

==== `object_classify_tf` stage

Download: https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/models/mobilenet_v1_2018_08_02/mobilenet_v1_1.0_224_quant.tgz[]

`object_classify_tf` uses a Google MobileNet v1 model to classify objects in the camera image. This stage requires a https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/models/mobilenet_v1_1.0_224_frozen.tgz[`labels.txt` file].

You can configure this stage with the following parameters:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| `top_n_results` | The number of results to show
| `refresh_rate` | The number of frames that must elapse between model runs
| `threshold_high` | Confidence threshold (between 0 and 1) where objects are considered as being present
| `threshold_low` | Confidence threshold which objects must drop below before being discarded as matches
| `model_file` | Filepath of the TFLite model file
| `labels_file` | Filepath of the file containing the object labels
| `display_labels` | Whether to display the object labels on the image; inserts `annotate.text` metadata for the `annotate_cv` stage to render
| `verbose` | Output more information to the console
|===

Example `object_classify_tf.json` file:

[source,json]
----
{
    "object_classify_tf" : {
        "top_n_results" : 2,
        "refresh_rate" : 30,
        "threshold_high" : 0.6,
        "threshold_low" : 0.4,
        "model_file" : "/home/<username>/models/mobilenet_v1_1.0_224_quant.tflite",
        "labels_file" : "/home/<username>/models/labels.txt",
        "display_labels" : 1
    },
    "annotate_cv" : {
        "text" : "",
        "fg" : 255,
        "bg" : 0,
        "scale" : 1.0,
        "thickness" : 2,
        "alpha" : 0.3
    }
}
----

The stage operates on a low resolution stream image of size 224×224.
Run the following command to use this stage file with `rpicam-hello`:

[source,console]
----
$ rpicam-hello --post-process-file object_classify_tf.json --lores-width 224 --lores-height 224

==== `pose_estimation_tf` stage

Download: https://github.com/Qengineering/TensorFlow_Lite_Pose_RPi_32-bits[]

`pose_estimation_tf` uses a Google MobileNet v1 model to detect pose information.

You can configure this stage with the following parameters:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| `refresh_rate` | The number of frames that must elapse between model runs
| `model_file` | Filepath of the TFLite model file
| `verbose` | Output extra information to the console
|===

Use the separate `plot_pose_cv` stage to draw the detected pose onto the main image.

You can configure the `plot_pose_cv` stage with the following parameters:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| `confidence_threshold` | Confidence threshold determining how much to draw; can be less than zero
|===

Example `pose_estimation_tf.json` file:

{
    "pose_estimation_tf" : {
        "refresh_rate" : 5,

    },
    "plot_pose_cv" : {
       "confidence_threshold" : -0.5
    }
}
----

The stage operates on a low resolution stream image of size 257×257. **Because YUV420 images must have even dimensions, round up to 258×258 for YUV420 images.**

Run the following command to use this stage file with `rpicam-hello`:

[source,console]
----
$ rpicam-hello --post-process-file pose_estimation_tf.json --lores-width 258 --lores-height 258

==== `object_detect_tf` stage

Download: https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/models/tflite/coco_ssd_mobilenet_v1_1.0_quant_2018_06_29.zip[]

`object_detect_tf` uses a Google MobileNet v1 SSD (Single Shot Detector) model to detect and label objects.

You can configure this stage with the following parameters:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| `refresh_rate` | The number of frames that must elapse between model runs
| `model_file` | Filepath of the TFLite model file
| `labels_file` | Filepath of the file containing the list of labels
| `confidence_threshold` | Confidence threshold before accepting a match
| `overlap_threshold` | Determines the amount of overlap between matches for them to be merged as a single match.
| `verbose` | Output extra information to the console
|===

Use the separate `object_detect_draw_cv` stage to draw the detected objects onto the main image.

You can configure the `object_detect_draw_cv` stage with the following parameters:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| `line_thickness` | Thickness of the bounding box lines
| `font_size` | Size of the font used for the label
|===

Example `object_detect_tf.json` file:

[source,json]
----
{
    "object_detect_tf" : {
        "number_of_threads" : 2,
        "refresh_rate" : 10,
        "confidence_threshold" : 0.5,
        "overlap_threshold" : 0.5,
        "model_file" : "/home/<username>/models/coco_ssd_mobilenet_v1_1.0_quant_2018_06_29/detect.tflite",
        "labels_file" : "/home/<username>/models/coco_ssd_mobilenet_v1_1.0_quant_2018_06_29/labelmap.txt",
        "verbose" : 1
    },
    "object_detect_draw_cv" : {
       "line_thickness" : 2
    }
}
----

The stage operates on a low resolution stream image of size 300×300. Run the following command, which passes a 300×300 crop to the detector from the centre of the 400×300 low resolution image, to use this stage file with `rpicam-hello`:

[source,console]
----
$ rpicam-hello --post-process-file object_detect_tf.json --lores-width 400 --lores-height 300

==== `segmentation_tf` stage

Download: https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/lite-model/deeplabv3/1/metadata/2?lite-format=tflite[]

`segmentation_tf` uses a Google MobileNet v1 model. This stage requires a label file, found at the `assets/segmentation_labels.txt`.

This stage runs on an image of size 257×257. Because YUV420 images must have even dimensions, the low resolution image should be at least 258 pixels in both width and height. The stage adds a vector of 257×257 values to the image metadata where each value indicates the categories a pixel belongs to. You can optionally draw a representation of the segmentation into the bottom right corner of the image.

You can configure this stage with the following parameters:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| `refresh_rate` | The number of frames that must elapse between model runs
| `model_file` | Filepath of the TFLite model file
| `labels_file` | Filepath of the file containing the list of labels
| `threshold` | When verbose is set, prints when the number of pixels with any label exceeds this number
| `draw` | Draws the segmentation map into the bottom right hand corner of the image
| `verbose` | Output extra information to the console
|===

Example `segmentation_tf.json` file:

[source,json]
----
{
    "segmentation_tf" : {
        "number_of_threads" : 2,
        "refresh_rate" : 10,
        "model_file" : "/home/<username>/models/lite-model_deeplabv3_1_metadata_2.tflite",
        "labels_file" : "/home/<username>/models/segmentation_labels.txt",
        "draw" : 1,
        "verbose" : 1
    }
}
----

This example takes a camera image and reduces it to 258×258 pixels in size. This stage even works when squashing a non-square image without cropping. This example enables the segmentation map in the bottom right hand corner.

Run the following command to use this stage file with `rpicam-hello`:

[source,console]
----
$ rpicam-hello --post-process-file segmentation_tf.json --lores-width 258 --lores-height 258 --viewfinder-width 1024 --viewfinder-height 1024
