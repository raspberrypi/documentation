== Network booting using IPv6

There are 4 stages to booting a Raspberry Pi computer over the network:

1. The bootloader negotiates to get an IP address and the details of a TFTP server using DHCP.
2. The bootloader loads the firmware via TFTP and hands over the boot process to the firmware, passing it the details of the network.
3. The firmware loads the kernel and command line via TFTP.
4. The kernel boots the rest of the system, loading the root filesystem (rootfs) via NFS or some other mechanism.

The bootloader and firmware (stages 1 to 3) have been enhanced to support booting over IPv6.

IMPORTANT: IPv6 netboot is an *experimental alpha feature* and depending on feedback, we may need to change how it works in future. This only works on Raspberry Pi 4 and Compute Module 4.

=== How it works

To boot via IPv6 you need an updated version of the firmware (e.g. `start4.elf`) and the bootloader. Using the latest release of Raspberry Pi OS and the latest stable bootloader should be sufficient.

NOTE: The commonly used `dnsmasq` DHCP server doesn't currently support the network boot parameters required for IPv6 network boot, so for the time being you will have to use a different DHCP server such as https://www.isc.org/dhcp/[ISC DHCP].

To mount `rootfs` over the network the xref:remote-access.adoc#network-boot-your-raspberry-pi[IPv4 netboot tutorial] suggests using `nfsroot`. This doesn't support IPv6, so another method is needed to mount `rootfs` over the network.

If your ISP and router don't support IPv6 you will be limited in what you can do.

==== Network addresses

The first thing the bootloader does is send a router solicitation to get the details of the network. The router responds with an advertisement packet identifying its ethernet address, which the bootloader might need if the TFTP server is on a different network.

The router advertisement includes a flag which tells it whether to use stateful (managed) or stateless (unmanaged) configuration for its IP address. Stateless configuration means that the device configures its own IP address. Currently the bootloader generates an address derived from its ethernet MAC address and a network prefix supplied by the router.

If the router indicates that stateful configuration is enabled DHCP is used to obtain the IP address of the device. This involves the device sending a solicitation request to a DHCP server which responds with an advertisement. The client then requests the address before getting a reply acknowledgement from the server.

DHCP Servers and clients identify themselves with variable length DUID (Device Unique ID). On the Raspberry Pi this is derived from the MAC address (DUID_LL).

==== TFTP address

Whether using stateless or stateful configuration, the DHCP server is used to obtain the TFTP server address. This is encoded in the `BOOTFILE-URL` parameter. We send the client architecture type value `0x29` to identify a device.

See https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5970[RFC 5970] and the https://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters/dhcpv6-parameters.xhtml[IANA Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6] documentation.

==== Boot process

The device should now have an IP address and TFTP details. It downloads the firmware binary `start4.elf` from the TFTP server and continues running with this. The firmware is passed the IP address and TFTP server details so it can download the kernel and boot the rest of the system.

==== Kernel Boot

With IPv4 netboot, `nfsroot` is used to mount `rootfs` over the network. This doesn't support IPv6 so another solution is required. It might involve a small RAM file system that can mount the appropriate network location before switching to the proper `rootfs` contents.

NOTE: A mechanism to boot the Linux kernel with NFS via IPv6 is still to be demonstrated.

=== Test Setup

If you want to try this out you will need another Raspberry Pi to act as the TFTP and DHCP server.

The TFTP server can in theory be on any routable network but the DHCP server has to be on the same network as the devices it will serve.

==== TFTP Server

If you have a working IPv4 network boot setup you can reuse the TFTP server in dnsmasq to supply the files (it can talk to both IPv4 and 
IPv6).

Alternatively you can use a standalone TFTP server like `tftpd-hpa`.

[,bash]
----
$ sudo apt-get install tftpd-hpa
$ sudo systemctl start tftpd-hpa
----

==== DHCP Server

DHCP in IPv6 has changed a lot. We need DHCP to at least tell us the address of the TFTP server, which in this case is the same machine.

[,bash]
----
$ sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server
----

Modify the configuration in `/etc/default/isc-dhcp-server`

[,bash]
----
DHCPDv6_CONF=/etc/dhcp/dhcpd6.conf
INTERFACESv6="eth0"
----

In `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd6.conf` you need to specify the TFTP server address and setup a subnet. Here the DHCP server is configured to supply some made up unique local addresses (ULA). The `host test-rpi4` line tells DHCP to give a test device a fixed address.

----

# Check if the client looks like a Raspberry Pi
if option dhcp6.client-arch-type = 00:29 {
        option dhcp6.bootfile-url "tftp://[fd49:869:6f93::1]/";
}

subnet6 fd49:869:6f93::/64 {
        host test-rpi4 {
                host-identifier option dhcp6.client-id 00:03:00:01:e4:5f:01:20:24:0b;
                fixed-address6 fd49:869:6f93::1000;
        }
}
----

Your server has to be assigned the IPv6 address in `/etc/dhcpcd.conf`

----
interface eth0
static ip6_address=fd49:869:6f93::1/64
----

Now start the DHCP server.

[,bash]
----
$ sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server.service
----

==== Bootloader

Modify the configuration to tell it to attempt network boot via IPv6 rather than IPv4.

----
BOOT_ORDER=0xf21 # 2=Network boot
USE_IPV6=1 # Enable IPv6 network boot
BOOT_UART=1 # Debug
----

To revert to IPv4 network boot just remove the `USE_IPV6` line from `boot.conf`.

==== Router

To use IPv6 you really need a router and ISP that supports IPv6. There are sites on the internet that can check this for you or alternatively run the following command.

[,bash]
----
sudo apt-get install ndisc6
rdisc6 -1 eth0
----

This sends a router solicitation to your router asking for your network details such as the network prefix, router ethernet address and whether to use DHCP for addressing. If there's no response to this command it's likely your network and ISP only supports IPv4. If IPv6 is supported it's most likely that it will be configured to use stateless configuration where clients generate their own addresses.

You might be able to configure your router for stateful configuration, which means it will use DHCP to obtain an IP address.

=== Debugging

==== Logs and Traces

If the boot uart is enabled you should see something like this from the serial port. The lines starting RX6 indicate that IPv6 is in use.

Here `dc:a6:32:6f:73:f4` is the MAC address of the TFTP server and it has an IPv6 address of `fd49:869:6f93::1`. The device itself has a MAC address `e4:5f:01:20:24:0b` and an IPv6 address of `fd49:869:6f93::1000`
