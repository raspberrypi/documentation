# SSH using Linux or Mac OS

You can use SSH to connect to your Raspberry Pi from a Linux computer or Mac (or from another Raspberry Pi) from the terminal, without installing additional software.

You should have SSH enabled on your Raspberry Pi. To enable SSH, 

1. Type `sudo raspi-config` in your Pi's terminal. The Raspberry Pi Software Configuration Tool page is displayed.
2. Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to select **5 Interfacing Options** and press **Enter**.
3. Select **P2 SSH** and press **Enter**.
4. Select **Yes** and press **Enter** to enable the SSH server.
5. Select **Finish**.

You'll need to know your Pi's IP address to connect to it. To find this, type `hostname -I` from your Pi's terminal.

Alternatively if you're running the Pi without a screen (headless), you can also look at the device list on your router or use a tool like `nmap`, which is described in detail in our [IP Address](../ip-address.md) document.

To connect to your Pi from a different computer, copy and paste the following command into the terminal window but replace `<IP>` with the IP address of the Raspberry Pi. Use `Ctrl + Shift + V` to paste in the terminal.

```
ssh pi@<IP>
```

If you receive a `connection timed out` error it is likely that you've entered the wrong IP address for the Raspberry Pi.

When the connection works you'll see a security/authenticity warning. Type `yes` to continue. You'll only see this warning the first time you connect.

In the event your Pi has taken the IP address of a device to which your computer has connected before (even if this was on another network), you may be given a warning and asked to clear the record from your list of known devices. Following this instruction and trying the `ssh` command again should be successful.

Next you'll be prompted for the password for the `pi` login: on Raspbian the default password is `raspberry`. You should now be able to see the Raspberry Pi prompt which will be identical to the one found on the Raspberry Pi itself.

If you have set up another user on the Pi, you can connect to it the same way, replacing the username with your own, e.g. `eben@192.168.1.5`

```
pi@raspberrypi ~ $
```

You are now connected to the Pi remotely and can execute commands.

## X-forwarding

You can also forward your X session over SSH to allow use of graphical applications by using the `-Y` flag:

```bash
ssh -Y pi@192.168.1.5
```

Now you're on the command line as before, but you have the ability to open up graphical windows, for example:

```bash
idle3 &
```

This will open up the Python editor IDLE in a graphical window.

```bash
scratch &
```

This will open up Scratch.

For further documentation on the `ssh` command just enter `man ssh` into the Terminal.

To configure your Pi to allow passwordless SSH access with a public/private key pair see the [passwordless SSH](passwordless.md) guide.
