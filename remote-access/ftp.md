# FTP

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) can be used to transfer files between a Raspberry Pi and another computer. For security reasons, it is advised not to use FTP, but rather use either [SFTP](ssh/sftp.md) or [SCP](ssh/scp.md). Both of these utilize encryption to protect the transfer and your user name and password.
