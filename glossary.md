- **config.txt** - a file located on the boot partition of a Raspberry Pi's SD card, which is parsed at boot time in order to enable, disable and manage operating system features which cannot be changed after booting. See the [offical documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/README.md)
- **CSI** - Camera Serial Interface. A hardware interface for connecting cameras to SoC's 
- **DHCP** - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, a network management protocol which dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on a network
- **DPI** - Parallel Display Interface, an up-to-24-bit parallel RGB interface via the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins
- **DSI** - Display Serial Interface. A Hardware interface for connecting LCD panels.
- **Device Tree (DT)** - A data structure for defining hardware. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_tree
- **Device Tree Source (DTS)** - A human readable source file to be compiled into a DTB
- **Device Tree Blob (DTB)** - A binary file containing a device tree, the result of compiling DTS files.
- **GPIO** - General Purpose Input/Output, the programmable pins on the Raspberry Pi
- **I<sup>2</sup>C** - Inter-Integrated Circuit (pronounced I-squared-C) an electrical protocol used for attaching lower-speed peripheral ICs to processors and microcontrollers in short-distance, intra-board communication. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C
- **LED** - Light-Emitting Diode, a semiconductor device that produces light from electricity
- **MSD** - Amoungst other things, a Mass Storage Device such as an SD card or hard disk drive.
