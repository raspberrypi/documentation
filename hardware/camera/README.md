# Camera Module

The Raspberry Pi Camera Module is an official product from the Raspberry Pi Foundation. The original 5-megapixel model was [released](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/camera-board-available-for-sale/) in 2013, and an 8-megapixel Camera Module v2 was [released](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/new-8-megapixel-camera-board-sale-25/) in 2016. For both iterations, there are visible light and infrared versions.
