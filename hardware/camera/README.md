# Camera Module

The Raspberry Pi Camera Modules are official products from the Raspberry Pi Foundation. The original 5-megapixel model was [released](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/camera-board-available-for-sale/) in 2013, and an 8-megapixel [Camera Module v2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/) was [released](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/new-8-megapixel-camera-board-sale-25/) in 2016. For both iterations, there are visible light and infrared versions. A 12-megapixel [High Quality Camera](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/) was [released](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/new-product-raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera-on-sale-now-at-50/) in 2020. There is no infrared version of the HQ Camera, however the [IR Filter can be removed](hqcam_filter_removal.md) if required.
