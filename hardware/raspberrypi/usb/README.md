## Overview for devices prior to Pi 4

The number and type of USB ports on Raspberry Pi depends on the model. The Raspberry Pi Model B is equipped with two USB 2.0 ports; the B+, 2B, 3B and 3B+ have four USB 2.0 ports. The Pi 4 has two USB 2.0 ports and two USB 3.0 ports. In all models prior to the Pi 4, the USB ports connect to a combo hub/Ethernet chip, which is itself a USB device connected to the single upstream USB port on BCM2835. On the Pi 4, the USB hub chip is connected to the SoC using a PCIe bus.

On the Model A and Zero range, the single USB 2.0 port is directly wired to the SoC.

The USB ports enable the attachment of peripherals such as keyboards, mice, webcams that provide the Pi with additional functionality.

There are some differences between the USB hardware on the Raspberry Pi and the USB hardware on desktop computers or laptop/tablet devices. 

The USB host port inside the Pi is an On-The-Go (OTG) host as the application processor powering the Pi, BCM2835, was originally intended to be used in the mobile market: i.e. as the single USB port on a phone for connection to a PC, or to a single device. In essence, the OTG hardware is simpler than the equivalent hardware on a PC.

OTG in general supports communication to all types of USB device, but to provide an adequate level of functionality for most of the USB devices that one might plug into a Pi, the system software has to do more work.

## Overview for the Pi 4

For the Pi 4, a fully-featured host controller drives the downstream USB ports. Downstream USB is provided by a Via Labs VL805 chip - that supports two USB 2.0 ports and two USB 3.0 ports. This is connected to the BCM2711 SoC using a PCIe link, which is extremely fast. Therefore, the Pi 4 does not have the same speed constraints of previous models, which means very fast data transfer rates, especially when using the USB 3.0 ports. All connected USB 2.0 devices are connected via an internal hub which connects to the upstream PCIe link via a single USB 2.0 bus, giving a maximum combined bandwith for all USB 2.0 devices of 480Mbits/s. All four USB ports on the device are connected to the USB 2.0 hub, whilst the USB 3.0 ports (blue) are ALSO connected to the USB 3.0 bus via the USB 3.0 specific pins in the socket. USB 3.0 devices are constrained only by the total bandwidth available over the PCIe link.

You can use `lsusb -t` to display how the USB devices and hubs are arranged and their allocated speeds. 

Most of the technical limitations of the USB implementation on previous models are no longer present.

The OTG hardware present on previous models of Pi is still available and it has moved to a single connection on the USB-C port. The OTG hardware is intended to be used in device-only mode on Pi 4.

## Supported devices

In general, every device supported by Linux is possible to use with the Pi, subject to a few caveats detailed further down. Linux has probably the most comprehensive driver database for legacy hardware of any operating system (it can lag behind for modern device support as it requires open-source drivers for Linux to recognise the device by default).

If you have a device and wish to use it with a Pi, then plug it in. Chances are that it'll "just work". If you are running in a graphical interface (such as the LXDE desktop environment in Raspbian), then it's likely that an icon or similar will pop up announcing the new device.

If the device doesn't appear to work, then refer to the Troubleshooting section below.

### General limitations (not Pi 4)

The OTG hardware on Raspberry Pi has a simpler level of support for certain devices, which may present a higher software processing overhead. The Raspberry Pi also has only one root USB port: all traffic from all connected devices is funnelled down this bus, which operates at a maximum speed of 480mbps.

The USB specification defines three device speeds - Low, Full and High. Most mice and keyboards are Low-speed, most USB sound devices are Full-speed and most video devices (webcams or video capture) are High-speed.

Generally, there are no issues with connecting multiple High-speed USB devices to a Pi.

The software overhead incurred when talking to Low- and Full-speed devices means that there are soft limitations on the number of simultaneously active Low- and Full-speed devices. Small numbers of these types of devices connected to a Pi will cause no issues.

### Port power limits

USB devices have defined power requirements, in units of 100mA from 100mA to 500mA. The device advertises its own power requirements to the USB host when it is first connected. In theory, the actual power consumed by the device should not exceed its stated requirement.

The USB ports on a Raspberry Pi 1 have a design loading of 100mA each - sufficient to drive "low-power" devices such as mice and keyboards. Devices such as WiFi adapters, USB hard drives, USB pen drives all consume much more current and should be powered from an external hub with its own power supply. While it is possible to plug a 500mA device into a Raspberry Pi 1 and have it work with a sufficiently powerful supply, reliable operation is not guaranteed. In addition, hotplugging high-power devices into the Raspberry Pi 1's USB ports may cause a brownout which can cause the Pi to reset.

For Raspberry Pi 2, the total power supplied to all USB ports in aggregate is 600mA by default, but can be increased to 1200mA using the `max_usb_current` config.txt entry.

From the Raspberry Pi 3 onwards, the total power supplied to all USB ports in aggregate is 1200mA.

See [Power](../power/README.md) for more information.

## Devices with known issues (not Pi 4)

**1. Interoperability between the Raspberry Pi and USB 3.0 hubs**  
   There is an issue with USB 3.0 hubs in conjunction with the use of full- or low-speed devices (most mice, most keyboards) and the Raspberry Pi. A bug in most USB 3.0 hub hardware means that the Raspberry Pi cannot talk to full- or low-speed devices connected to a USB 3.0 hub.

   USB 2.0 high-speed devices, including USB 2.0 hubs, operate correctly when connected via a USB 3.0 hub.

   Avoid connecting low- or full-speed devices into a USB 3.0 hub. As a workaround, plug a USB 2.0 hub into the downstream port of the USB 3.0 hub and connect the low-speed device, or use a USB 2.0 hub between the Pi and the USB 3.0 hub, then plug low-speed devices into the USB 2.0 hub.

**2. USB 1.1 webcams**  
   Old webcams may be Full-speed devices. Because these devices transfer a lot of data and incur additional software overhead, reliable operation is not guaranteed.  
   As a workaround, try to use the camera at a lower resolution.

**3. Esoteric USB sound cards**  
  Expensive "audiophile" sound cards typically use far more bandwidth than is necessary to stream audio playback. Reliable operation with 96kHz/192kHz DACs is not guaranteed.  
  As a workaround, forcing the output stream to be CD quality (44.1kHz/48kHz 16-bit) will reduce the stream bandwidth to reliable levels.

**4. Single-TT USB hubs**  
  USB 2.0 and 3.0 hubs have a mechanism for talking to full- or low-speed devices connected to their downstream ports called a Transaction Translator. This device buffers high-speed requests from the host (i.e. the Pi) and transmits them at full- or low-speed to the downstream device. Two configurations of hub are allowed by the USB specification: Single-TT (one TT for all ports) and Multi-TT (one TT per port).  
  Because of the OTG hardware limitations, if too many full- or low-speed devices are plugged into a single-TT hub, unreliable operation of the devices may occur. It is recommended to use a Multi-TT hub to interface with multiple lower-speed devices.  
  As a workaround, spread lower-speed devices out between the Pi's own USB port and the single-TT hub.

## Troubleshooting

### If your device doesn't work at all

The first step is to see if it is detected at all. There are two commands that can be entered into a terminal for this: `lsusb` and `dmesg`. The first will print out all devices attached to USB, whether they are actually recognised by a device driver or not, and the second will print out the kernel message buffer (which can be quite big after booting - try doing `sudo dmesg -C` then plug in your device and retype `dmesg` to see new messages).

As an example with a USB pendrive:

```bash
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ lsusb

Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

```

In this case, there are no error messages in `dmesg` and the pendrive is detected by the usb-storage driver. If your device did not have a driver available, then typically only the first 6 new lines will appear in the dmesg printout.

If a device enumerates without any errors, but doesn't appear to do anything, then it is likely there are no drivers installed for it. Search around, based on the manufacturer's name for the device or the USB IDs that are displayed in lsusb (e.g. 05dc:a781). The device may not be supported with default Linux drivers - and you may need to download or compile your own third-party software.

#### If your device has intermittent behaviour

Poor quality power is the most common cause of devices not working, disconnecting or generally being unreliable.  

- If you are using an external powered hub, try swapping the power adapter supplied with the hub for another compatible power supply with the same voltage rating and polarity.
- Check to see if the problem resolves itself if you remove other devices from the hub's downstream ports.
- Temporarily plug the device directly into the Pi and see if the behaviour improves.
