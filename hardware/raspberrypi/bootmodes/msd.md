# How to boot from a USB Mass Storage Device on a Raspberry Pi 3
This tutorial explains how to boot your Raspberry Pi 3 from a USB mass storage device such as a flash drive or USB hard disk. Be warned that this feature is experimental and may not work with all USB mass storage devices.

## Before Starting
If this is a blank SD card (not setup with NOOBS or the following 'normal way'), then install Raspbian Lite (or Raspbian with PIXEL) on the SD card in the normal way [See here](../../../installation/installing-images/README.md).  

Check to make sure your SD card partitions are right for this example:
```
$ lsblk
```
NAME        | MAJ:MIN | RM  | SIZE | RO | TYPE | MOUNTPOINT         |
------------|---------|-----|------|----|------|--------------------|
mmcblk0     | 179:0   |  0  | 7.4G | 0  | disk |                    |
├─mmcblk0p1 | 179:1   |  0  |  66M | 0  | part | /boot              |
├─mmcblk0p2 | 179:2   |  0  |   5G | 0  | part | /                  |
├─mmcblk0p5 | 179:5   |  0  |  32M | 0  | part | /media/pi/SETTINGS | 
├─mmcblk0p6 | 179:6   |  0  | 2.3G | 0  | part |                    | 
└─mmcblk0p7 | 179:7   |  0  |   1K | 0  | part |                    |

Mountpoint '/boot' (last column) should be assigned to the mmcblk0p1 partition and Mountpoint '/' (root) should be assigned to the mmcblk0p2 partition.  If not, for example if the SD card was setup using NOOBS then '/boot' and '/' might be assigned to mmcblk0p6 and mmcblk0p7 respectively.  This would change the sed commands below the "Edit `/boot/cmdline.txt` etc..." line. The sed command just below this line and the two fstab sed commands will have to be modified to reflect that change.  For example the 3 sed commands would be:  

sudo sed -i "s,root=/dev/mmcblk0p7,root=/dev/sda2," /mnt/target/boot/cmdline.txt  
sudo sed -i "s,/dev/mmcblk0p6,/dev/sda1," /mnt/target/etc/fstab  
sudo sed -i "s,/dev/mmcblk0p7,/dev/sda2," /mnt/target/etc/fstab   

*note: also make sure no other usb devices are plugged in  

## Program USB Boot Mode
Before a Raspberry Pi will boot from a mass storage device, it needs to be booted from an SD card with a config option to enable USB boot mode. This will set a bit in the OTP (One Time Programmable) memory in the Raspberry Pi SoC that enables network booting. Once this is done, the SD card is no longer required. 

First, prepare the `/boot` directory with up to date boot files:
```
$ sudo apt-get update
```
Then enable USB boot mode with this code: 
```
echo program_usb_boot_mode=1 | sudo tee -a /boot/config.txt
```

This adds `program_usb_boot_mode=1` to the end of `/boot/config.txt`. Reboot the Raspberry Pi with `sudo reboot`, then check that the OTP has been programmed with:

```
$ vcgencmd otp_dump | grep 17:
17:3020000a
```

Ensure the output `0x3020000a` is correct.

If you wish, you can remove the `program_usb_boot_mode` line from config.txt, so that if you put the SD card in another Raspberry Pi, it won't program USB boot mode. Make sure there is no blank line at the end of config.txt. You can do this with `sudo nano /boot/config.txt`, for example.

## Prepare the USB storage device
Now that your Raspberry Pi is USB boot-enabled, you can prepare a USB storage device to boot from. Start by inserting the USB storage device into the Raspberry Pi. Note that the USB storage device will be completely erased. Rather than downloading the Raspbian image again, we will copy it from the SD card on the Raspberry Pi. The source device (SD card) will be `/dev/mmcblk0` and the destination device (USB disk) should be `/dev/sda`, assuming you have no other USB devices connected.

We will start by using Parted to create a 100MB FAT32 partition, followed by a Linux ext4 partition that will take up the rest of the disk.

```
sudo parted /dev/sda

(parted) mktable msdos
Warning: Partition(s) on /dev/sda are being used.
Ignore/Cancel? ignore
Warning: The existing disk label on /dev/sda will be destroyed and all data on this disk will be lost.  
Do you want to continue?
Yes/No? Yes
Error: Partition(s) 1 on /dev/sda have been written, but we have been unable to
inform the kernel of the change, probably because it/they are in use. As a
result, the old partition(s) will remain in use. You should reboot now before
making further changes.
Ignore/Cancel? cancel
(parted) quit
reboot
sudo parted /dev/sda
(parted) mkpart primary fat32 0% 100M
(parted) mkpart primary ext4 100M 100%
(parted) print
Model: SanDisk Cruzer (scsi)  
Disk /dev/sda: 7761MB  
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B  
Partition Table: msdos  
Disk Flags:  

Number  Start   End     Size    Type     File system  Flags  
 1      1049kB  99.6MB  98.6MB  primary  fat32        lba  
 2      99.6MB  7761MB  7661MB  primary  ext4  
```
Your `parted print` output should look similar to the one above.

Type `quit` to exit parted.

Create the boot and root file systems:
```
sudo mkfs.vfat -n BOOT -F 32 /dev/sda1
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2
```

Mount the target file system and copy the running Raspbian system to it:
```
sudo mkdir /mnt/target
sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/target/
sudo mkdir /mnt/target/boot
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/target/boot/
sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install rsync
sudo rsync -ax --progress / /boot /mnt/target
```

Regenerate SSH host keys:
```
cd /mnt/target
sudo mount --bind /dev dev
sudo mount --bind /sys sys
sudo mount --bind /proc proc
sudo chroot /mnt/target
rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host*
dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server
exit
reboot
sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/target/
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/target/boot/
```

Edit `/boot/cmdline.txt` so that it uses the USB storage device as the root file system, instead of the SD card.

```
sudo sed -i "s,root=/dev/mmcblk0p2,root=/dev/sda2," /mnt/target/boot/cmdline.txt
```

The same needs to be done for `fstab`:
```
sudo sed -i "s,/dev/mmcblk0p1,/dev/sda1," /mnt/target/etc/fstab
sudo sed -i "s,/dev/mmcblk0p2,/dev/sda2," /mnt/target/etc/fstab
```

Finally, unmount the target file systems, and power the Raspberry Pi off.
```
cd ~
sudo umount /mnt/target/boot 
sudo umount /mnt/target
```
(after doing the power off below disconnect the power supply from the Raspberry Pi, remove the SD card,  
and reconnect the power supply. If all has gone well, the Raspberry Pi should begin to boot after a few seconds.)
```
sudo poweroff 
```
