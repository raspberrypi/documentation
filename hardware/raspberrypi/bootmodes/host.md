# USB host boot mode

**USB host boot is available on Raspberry Pi 3B, 3B+, 3A+, and 2B v1.2 only. Raspberry Pi 3A+ only supports mass storage boot, not network boot.**

The USB host boot mode follows this sequence:

* Enable the USB port and wait for D+ line to be pulled high indicating a USB 2.0 device (we only support USB2.0)
* If the device is a hub:
  * Enable power to all downstream ports of the hub
  * For each port, loop for a maximum of two seconds (or five seconds if `program_usb_boot_timeout=1` has been set)
    * Release from reset and wait for D+ to be driven high to indicate that a device is connected
    * If a device is detected:
      * Send "Get Device Descriptor"
        * If VID == SMSC && PID == 9500
          * Add device to Ethernet device list
        * If class interface == mass storage class
          * Add device to mass storage device list
* Else
  * Enumerate single device
* Go through mass storage device list
  * [Boot from mass storage device](msd.md)
* Go through Ethernet device list
  * [Boot from Ethernet](net.md)
