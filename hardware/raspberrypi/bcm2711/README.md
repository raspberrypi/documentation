# BCM2711

This is the Broadcom chip used in the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. The architecture of the BCM2711 is a considerable upgrade on that used by the SoCs in earlier Pi models. It continues the quad-core CPU design of the BCM2837, but uses the more powerful ARM A72 core. It has a greatly improved GPU feature set with much faster input/output, due to the incorporation of a PCIe link that connects the USB 2 and USB 3 ports, and a natively attached Ethernet controller. It is also capable of addressing more memory than the SoCs used before.

The ARM cores are capable of running at up to 1.5 GHz, making the Pi 4 about 50% faster than the Raspberry Pi 3B+. The new VideoCore VI 3D unit now runs at up to 500 MHz. The ARM cores are 64-bit, and while the VideoCore is 32-bit, there is a new Memory Management Unit, which means it can access more memory than previous versions.

The BCM2711 chip continues to use the heat spreading technology started with the BCM2837B0, which provides better thermal management. 

A preliminary datasheet for the BCM2711 can be found [here](./rpi_DATA_2711_1p0_preliminary.pdf).
